            CLASSICAL FIRST ORDER LOGIC WITH EQUALITY
###############################################################################

  Logic can be defined as the "study of the principles of correct reasoning"
  (Merrilee H. Salmon's 1991 "Informal Reasoning and Informal Logic" in
  _Informal Reasoning and Education_ ) or as "a formal system using symbolic
  techniques and mathematical methods to establish truth-values" (the Oxford
  English Dictionary).

  This section formally defines the logic system we will use.  In particular,
  it defines symbols for declaring truthful statements, along with rules for
  deriving truthful statements from other truthful statements.  The system
  defined here is classical first order logic with equality (the most common
  logic system used by mathematicians).

  We begin with a few housekeeping items in pre-logic, and then introduce
  propositional calculus (both its axioms and important theorems that can be
  derived from them).  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about
  well-formed formulas (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  This is
  followed by proofs that other axiomatizations of classical propositional
  calculus can be derived from the axioms we have chosen to use.

  We then define predicate calculus, which adds additional symbols and rules
  useful for discussing objects (beyond simply true or false).  In particular,
  it introduces the symbols ` = ` ("equals"), ` e. ` ("is a member of"), and `
  A. ` ("for all").  The first two are called "predicates."  A predicate
  specifies a true or false relationship between its two arguments.

       never appear in a completed proof.  It can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic - please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The metamath program's Proof Assistant requires proofs to be developed
       backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no mechanism that
       lets the user to work on isolated subproofs.  This inference provides a
       workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any point in a
       proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the side, for
       later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:  (1) Assign this inference to any unknown step in the
       proof.  Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       'assign last' can be used.  This step will be replicated in hypothesis
       a1ii.1, from where the development of the main proof can continue.  (2)
       Develop the independent subproof backwards from hypothesis a1ii.2.  If
       desired, use a 'let' command to pre-assign the conclusion of the
       independent subproof to a1ii.2.  (3) After the independent subproof is
       complete, use 'improve all' to assign it automatically to an unknown
       step in the main proof that matches it.  (4) After the entire proof is
       complete, use 'minimize *' to clean up (discard) all ~ a1ii references
       automatically.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  (Contributed by NM, 7-Feb-2006.) $)

#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Propositional calculus deals with general truths about well-formed formulas
  (wffs) regardless of how they are constructed.  The simplest propositional
  truth is ` ( ph -> ph ) ` , which can be read "if something is true, then it
  is true" - rather trivial and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from
  the axioms (see theorem ~ id ).

  Our system of propositional calculus consists of three basic axioms and
  another axiom that defines the modus-ponens inference rule.  It is attributed
  to Jan Lukasiewicz (pronounced woo-kah-SHAY-vitch) and was popularized by
  Alonzo Church, who called it system P2.  (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this
  information.)  These axioms are ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and (for modus
  ponens) ~ ax-mp . Some closely followed texts include [Margaris] for the
  axioms and [WhiteheadRussell] for the theorems.

  The propositional calculus used here is the classical system widely used by
  mathematicians.  In particular, this logic system accepts the "law of the
  excluded middle" as proven in ~ exmid , which says that a logical statement
  is either true or not true.  This is an essential distinction of classical
  logic and is not a theorem of intuitionistic logic.

  All 194 axioms, definitions, and theorems for propositional calculus in
  _Principia Mathematica_ (specifically *1.2 through *5.75) are axioms or
  formally proven.  See the Bibliographic Cross-References at
  ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmbiblio.html for a complete
  cross-reference from sources used to its formalization in the Metamath
  Proof Explorer.

  $( If ` ph ` is a wff, so is ` -. ph ` or "not ` ph ` ."  Part of the
     recursive definition of a wff (well-formed formula).  In classical logic
     (which is our logic), a wff is interpreted as either true or false.  So if
     ` ph ` is true, then ` -. ph ` is false; if ` ph ` is false, then
     ` -. ph ` is true.  Traditionally, Greek letters are used to represent
     wffs, and we follow this convention.  In propositional calculus, we define
     only wffs built up from other wffs, i.e. there is no starting or "atomic"
     wff.  Later, in predicate calculus, we will extend the basic wff
     definition by including atomic wffs ( ~ weq and ~ wel ). $)
  wn $a wff -. ph $.

  $( If ` ph ` and ` ps ` are wff's, so is ` ( ph -> ps ) ` or " ` ph ` implies
     ` ps ` ."  Part of the recursive definition of a wff.  The resulting wff
     is (interpreted as) false when ` ph ` is true and ` ps ` is false; it is
     true otherwise.  Think of the truth table for an OR gate with input ` ph `
     connected through an inverter.  After we define the axioms of
     propositional calculus ( ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and ~ ax-mp ), the
     biconditional ( ~ df-bi ), the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ), and the
     constant false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth
     table values: ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truimtru ),
     ` ( ( T. -> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ truimfal ), ` ( ( F. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ falimtru ), and ` ( ( F. -> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falimfal ).  These
     have straightforward meanings, for example, ` ( ( T. -> T. ) <-> T. ) `
     just means "the value of ` T. -> T. ` is ` T. ` ".

     The left-hand wff is called the antecedent, and the right-hand wff is
     called the consequent.  In the case of ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , the
     middle ` ps ` may be informally called either an antecedent or part of the
     consequent depending on context.  Contrast with ` <-> ` ( ~ df-bi ),
     ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), and ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ).

     This is called "material implication" and the arrow is usually read as
     "implies."  However, material implication is not identical to the meaning
     of "implies" in natural language.  For example, the word "implies" may
     suggest a causal relationship in natural language.  Material implication
     does not require any causal relationship.  Also, note that in material
     implication, if the consequent is true then the wff is always true (even
     if the antecedent is false).  Thus, if "implies" means material
     implication, it is true that "if the moon is made of green cheese that
     implies that 5=5" (because 5=5).  Similarly, if the antecedent is false,
     the wff is always true.  Thus, it is true that, "if the moon made of green
     cheese that implies that 5=7" (because the moon is not actually made of
     green cheese).  A contradiction implies anything ( ~ pm2.21i ).  In short,
     material implication has a very specific technical definition, and
     misunderstandings of it are sometimes called "paradoxes of logical
     implication." $)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
        The axioms of propositional calculus
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Postulate the three axioms of classical propositional calculus.

  Propositional calculus (axioms ~ ax-1 through ~ ax-3 and rule ~ ax-mp ) can
  be thought of as asserting formulas that are universally "true" when their
  variables are replaced by any combination of "true" and "false."
  Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege in 1879, using as his
  axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ pm2.04 ,
  ~ con3 , ~ notnot2 , and ~ notnot1 . Around 1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the
  system by eliminating the third (which follows from the first two, as you can
  see by looking at the proof of ~ pm2.04 ) and replacing the last three with
  our ~ ax-3 . (Thanks to Ted Ulrich for this information.)

  The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
  Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
  true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we assign
  all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables and verify
  that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn ) always
  evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our approach is
  called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is derived from axioms.
  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for Propositional Calculus
  shows that the two approaches are equivalent and even provides an algorithm
  for automatically generating syntactic proofs from a truth table.  Those
  proofs, however, tend to be long, since truth tables grow exponentially with
  the number of variables, and the much shorter proofs that we show here were
  found manually.

     statement "if there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies
     the statement "if it is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This axiom
     is called _Transp_ or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia
     Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also
     use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is
     advised that in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a
     different technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

    $( Deduction introducing an embedded antecedent.

       _Naming convention_:  We often call a theorem a "deduction" and suffix
       its label with "d" whenever the hypotheses and conclusion are each
       prefixed with the same antecedent.  This allows us to use the theorem in
       places where (in traditional textbook formalizations) the standard
       Deduction Theorem would be used; here ` ph ` would be replaced with a
       conjunction ( ~ df-an ) of the hypotheses of the would-be deduction.  By
       contrast, we tend to call the simpler version with no common antecedent
       an "inference" and suffix its label with "i"; compare theorem ~ a1i .
       Finally, a "theorem" would be the form with no hypotheses; in this case
       the "theorem" form would be the original axiom ~ ax-1 .  We usually show
       the theorem form without a suffix on its label (e.g. ~ pm2.43 vs.
       ~ pm2.43i vs. ~ pm2.43d ).  When an inference is converted to a theorem
       by eliminating an "is a set" hypothesis, we sometimes suffix the theorem
       form with "g" (for "more general") as in ~ uniex vs. ~ uniexg .

  $( Define the biconditional (logical 'iff').

     The definition ~ df-bi in this section is our first definition, which
     introduces and defines the biconditional connective ` <-> ` .  We define a
     wff of the form ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an abbreviation for
     ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

     Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a
     separate symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as."  Instead, we will
     later use the biconditional connective for this purpose ( ~ df-or is its
     first use), as it allows us to use logic to manipulate definitions
     directly.  This greatly simplifies many proofs since it eliminates the
     need for a separate mechanism for introducing and eliminating
     definitions.  Of course, we cannot use this mechanism to define the
     biconditional itself, since it hasn't been introduced yet.  Instead, we
     use a more general form of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` -. ( ( ph -> ps ) -> -. ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the
     defining expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the
     previously proved theorem ~ bijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to
     prove any statement expressed in the original language that can't be
     proved from the original axioms, because if we simply replace each
     instance of ~ df-bi in the proof with the corresponding ~ bijust instance,
     we will end up with a proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are not strengthening the language.  To indicate this
     fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just a naming convention for human readability.)

     After we define the constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant
     false ` F. ` ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth table
     values: ` ( ( T. <-> T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ trubitru ),
     ` ( ( T. <-> F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ trubifal ), ` ( ( F. <-> T. ) <-> F. ) `
     ( ~ falbitru ), and ` ( ( F. <-> F. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falbifal ).

     See ~ dfbi1 , ~ dfbi2 , and ~ dfbi3 for theorems suggesting typical
     textbook definitions of ` <-> ` , showing that our definition has the
     properties we expect.  Theorem ~ dfbi1 is particularly useful if we want
     to eliminate ` <-> ` from an expression to convert it to primitives.
     Theorem ~ dfbi shows this definition rewritten in an abbreviated form
     after conjunction is introduced, for easier understanding.

     Contrast with ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ ` ( ~ df-nan ),
     and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ) .  In some sense ` <-> ` returns true if two
     truth values are equal; ` = ` ( ~ df-cleq ) returns true if two classes
     are equal.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

     any axiom (or theorem) could be used.  It might be thought, therefore,
     that it is in some sense redundant, but in fact no proof is shorter than
     this (measured by number of steps).  Third, it illustrates how
     intermediate steps can "blow up" in size even in short proofs.  Fourth,
     the compressed proof is only 182 bytes (or 17 bytes in D-proof notation),
     but the generated web page is over 200kB with intermediate steps that are
     essentially incomprehensible to humans (other than Gregory Bush).  If
     there were an obfuscated code contest for proofs, this would be a
     contender.  This "blowing up" and incomprehensibility of the intermediate
     steps vividly demonstrate the advantages of using many layered
     intermediate theorems, since each theorem is easier to understand.

  Here we define disjunction (logical 'or') ` \/ ` ( ~ df-or ) and conjunction
  (logical 'and') ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ). We also define various rules for
  simplifying and applying them, e.g., ~ olc , ~ orc , and ~ orcom .

  $( Extend wff definition to include disjunction ('or'). $)
  wo $a wff ( ph \/ ps ) $.
  $( Extend wff definition to include conjunction ('and'). $)
  wa $a wff ( ph /\ ps ) $.

  $( Define disjunction (logical 'or').  Definition of [Margaris] p. 49.  When
     the left operand, right operand, or both are true, the result is true;
     when both sides are false, the result is false.  For example, it is true
     that (2 = 3 ` \/ ` 4 = 4) (see ex-or in set.mm).  After we define the
     constant true ` T. ` ( ~ df-tru ) and the constant false ` F. `
     ( ~ df-fal ), we will be able to prove these truth table values:
     ` ( ( T. \/ T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ truortru ), ` ( ( T. \/ F. ) <-> T. ) `
     ( ~ truorfal ), ` ( ( F. \/ T. ) <-> T. ) ` ( ~ falortru ), and
     ` ( ( F. \/ F. ) <-> F. ) ` ( ~ falorfal ).

     This is our first use of the biconditional connective in a definition; we
     use the biconditional connective in place of the traditional "<=def=>",
     which means the same thing, except that we can manipulate the
     biconditional connective directly in proofs rather than having to rely on
     an informal definition substitution rule.  Note that if we mechanically
     substitute ` ( -. ph -> ps ) ` for ` ( ph \/ ps ) ` , we end up with an
     instance of previously proved theorem ~ biid .  This is the justification
     for the definition, along with the fact that it introduces a new symbol
     ` \/ ` .  Contrast with ` /\ ` ( ~ df-an ), ` -> ` ( ~ wi ), ` -/\ `
     ( ~ df-nan ), and ` \/_ ` ( ~ df-xor ) .  (Contributed by NM,

  $( Carew Meredith's sole axiom for propositional calculus.  This amazing
     formula is thought to be the shortest possible single axiom for
     propositional calculus with inference rule ~ ax-mp , where negation and
     implication are primitive.  Here we prove Meredith's axiom from ~ ax-1 ,
     ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-3 .  Then from it we derive the Lukasiewicz axioms
     ~ luk-1 , ~ luk-2 , and ~ luk-3 .  Using these we finally re-derive our
     axioms as ~ ax1 , ~ ax2 , and ~ ax3 , thus proving the equivalence of all
     three systems.  C. A. Meredith, "Single Axioms for the Systems (C,N),
     (C,O) and (A,N) of the Two-Valued Propositional Calculus," _The Journal of
     Computing Systems_ vol. 1 (1953), pp. 155-164.  Meredith claimed to be
     close to a proof that this axiom is the shortest possible, but the proof
     was apparently never completed.

     An obscure Irish lecturer, Meredith (1904-1976) became enamored with logic
     somewhat late in life after attending talks by Lukasiewicz and produced
     many remarkable results such as this axiom.  From his obituary:  "He did
     logic whenever time and opportunity presented themselves, and he did it on
     whatever materials came to hand: in a pub, his favored pint of porter
     within reach, he would use the inside of cigarette packs to write proofs
     for logical colleagues."  (Contributed by NM, 14-Dec-2002.)  (Proof

                Stoic logic indemonstrables (Chrysippus of Soli)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic.
  The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest
  logicians of antiquity.
  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses
  on propositional logic,
  though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle.
  Jan Lukasiewicz reports,
  "For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident
  that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic"
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).
  For more about Aristotle's system, see ~ barbara and related theorems.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in
  general it is difficult to assign specific
  ideas to specific thinkers.
  The indemonstrables are described in, for example,
  [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5.
  These indemonstrables are
  modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp ,
  modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto ,
  modus ponendo tollens I ~ mpto1 ,
  modus ponendo tollens II ~ mpto2 , and
  modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtp-xor .
  The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section
  we prove the other three.
  Since we assume or prove all of indemonstrables, the system of logic we use
  here is as at least as strong as the set of Stoic indemonstrables.
  Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtp-xor originally used exclusive-or,
  but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred
  to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtp-or .
  This set of indemonstrables is not the entire system of Stoic logic.

    Predicate calculus with equality:  Tarski's system S2 (1 rule, 6 schemes)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  Here we extend the language of wffs with predicate calculus, which allows us
  to talk about individual objects in a domain of discussion (which for us will
  be the universe of all sets, so we call them "setvar variables") and make
  true/false statements about predicates, which are relationships between
  objects, such as whether or not two objects are equal.  In addition, we
  introduce universal quantification ("for all") in order to make statements
  about whether a wff holds for every object in the domain of discussion.
  Later we introduce existential quantification ("there exists", ~ df-ex )
  which is defined in terms of universal quantification.

  Our axioms are really axiom _schemes_, and our wff and setvar variables are
  metavariables ranging over expressions in an underlying "object language."
  This is explained here:  ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html#axiomnote

  Our axiom system starts with the predicate calculus axiom schemes system S2
  of Tarski defined in his 1965 paper, "A Simplified Formalization of Predicate
  Logic with Identity" [Tarski].  System S2 is defined in the last paragraph on
  p. 77, and repeated on p. 81 of [KalishMontague].  We do not include scheme
  B5 (our ~ sp ) since [KalishMontague] shows it to be logically redundant
  (Lemma 9, p. 87, which we prove as theorem ~ spw below).

  Theorem ~ spw can be used to prove any instance of ~ sp having no wff
  metavariables and mutually distinct setvar variables.  However, it seems that
  ~ sp in its general form cannot be derived from only Tarski's schemes.  We
  do not include B5 i.e.  ~ sp as part of what we call "Tarski's system"
  because we want it to be the smallest set of axioms that is logically
  complete with no redundancies.  We later prove ~ sp as theorem ~ ax4
  using the auxiliary axioms that make our system metalogically complete.

  Our version of Tarski's system S2 consists of propositional calculus plus
  ~ ax-gen , ~ ax-5 , ~ ax-17 , ~ ax-9 , ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-13 , and ~ ax-14 . The
  last 3 are equality axioms that represent 3 sub-schemes of Tarski's scheme
  B8.  Due to its side-condition ("where ` ph ` is an atomic formula and ` ps `
  is obtained by replacing an occurrence of the variable ` x ` by the variable
  ` y ` "), we cannot represent his B8 directly without greatly complicating
  our scheme language, but the simpler schemes ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-13 , and ~ ax-14
  are sufficient for set theory.

  Tarski's system is exactly equivalent to the traditional axiom system in most
  logic textbooks but has the advantage of being easy to manipulate with a
  computer program, and its simpler metalogic (with no built-in notions of free
  variable and proper substitution) is arguably easier for a non-logician human
  to follow step by step in a proof.

  However, in our system that derives schemes (rather than object language
  theorems) from other schemes, Tarski's S2 is not complete.  For example, we
  cannot derive scheme ~ sp , even though (using ~ spw ) we can derive all
  instances of it that don't involve wff metavariables or bundled setvar
  metavariables.  (Two setvar metavariables are "bundled" if they can be
  substituted with the same setvar metavariable i.e. do not have a $d distinct
  variable proviso.)  Later we will introduce auxiliary axiom schemes ~ ax-6 ,
  ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-12 , and ~ ax-11 that are metatheorems of Tarski's system (i.e.
  are logically redundant) but which give our system the property of
  "metalogical completeness," allowing us to prove directly (instead of, say,
  by induction on formula length) all possible schemes that can be expressed in
  our language.

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free
     in ` ph ` ".  Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the
     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` (see ~ nfequid ),
     even though ` x ` would be considered free in the usual textbook
     definition, because the value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot
     affect the truth of the expression (and thus substitution will not change
     the result).

     This predicate only applies to wffs.  See ~ df-nfc for a not-free
     predicate for class variables.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro,

    $( Inference from Theorem 19.23 of [Margaris] p. 90.

       This inference, along with our many variants such as ~ rexlimdv , is
       used to implement a metatheorem called "Rule C" that is given in many
       logic textbooks.  See, for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C
       in [Margaris] p. 40, or Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic
       and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF p. 65) at
       ~ http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~~hirstjl/primer/hirst.pdf .

       In informal proofs, the statement "Let ` C ` be an element such that..."
       almost always means an implicit application of Rule C.

       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `
       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has
       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( C ) ` as a hypothesis for the proof
       where ` C ` is a new (ficticious) constant not appearing previously in
       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The
       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.

  $( This syntax construction states that a variable ` x ` , which has been
     declared to be a setvar variable by $f statement vx, is also a class
     expression.  This can be justified informally as follows.  We know that
     the class builder ` { y | y e. x } ` is a class by ~ cab .  Since (when
     ` y ` is distinct from ` x ` ) we have ` x = { y | y e. x } ` by
     ~ cvjust , we can argue that the syntax " ` class x ` " can be viewed as
     an abbreviation for " ` class { y | y e. x } ` ".  See the discussion
     under the definition of class in [Jech] p. 4 showing that "Every set can
     be considered to be a class."

     While it is tempting and perhaps occasionally useful to view ~ cv as a
     "type conversion" from a setvar variable to a class variable, keep in mind
     that ~ cv is intrinsically no different from any other class-building
     syntax such as ~ cab , ~ cun , or ~ c0 .

     For a general discussion of the theory of classes and the role of ~ cv ,
     see ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html#class .

     (The description above applies to set theory, not predicate calculus.  The
     purpose of introducing ` class x ` here, and not in set theory where it
     belongs, is to allow us to express i.e.  "prove" the ~ weq of predicate
     calculus from the ~ wceq of set theory, so that we don't "overload" the
     ` = ` connective with two syntax definitions.  This is done to prevent

  $( Define proper substitution.  Remark 9.1 in [Megill] p. 447 (p. 15 of the
     preprint).  For our notation, we use ` [ y / x ] ph ` to mean "the wff
     that results from the proper substitution of ` y ` for ` x ` in the wff
     ` ph ` ."  We can also use ` [ y / x ] ph ` in place of the "free for"
     side condition used in traditional predicate calculus; see, for example,
     ~ stdpc4 .

     Our notation was introduced in Haskell B. Curry's _Foundations of
     Mathematical Logic_ (1977), p. 316 and is frequently used in textbooks of
     lambda calculus and combinatory logic.  This notation improves the common
     but ambiguous notation, " ` ph ( y ) ` is the wff that results when ` y `
     is properly substituted for ` x ` in ` ph ( x ) ` ."  For example, if the
     original ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = y ` , then ` ph ( y ) ` is ` y = y ` , from
     which we obtain that ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = x ` .  So what exactly does
     ` ph ( x ) ` mean?  Curry's notation solves this problem.

     In most books, proper substitution has a somewhat complicated recursive
     definition with multiple cases based on the occurrences of free and bound
     variables in the wff.  Instead, we use a single formula that is exactly
     equivalent and gives us a direct definition.  We later prove that our
     definition has the properties we expect of proper substitution (see
     theorems ~ sbequ , ~ sbcom2 and ~ sbid2v ).

     Note that our definition is valid even when ` x ` and ` y ` are replaced
     with the same variable, as ~ sbid shows.  We achieve this by having ` x `
     free in the first conjunct and bound in the second.  We can also achieve
     this by using a dummy variable, as the alternate definition ~ dfsb7 shows
     (which some logicians may prefer because it doesn't mix free and bound
     variables).  Another version that mixes free and bound variables is
     ~ dfsb3 .  When ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct, we can express proper
     substitution with the simpler expressions of ~ sb5 and ~ sb6 .

     There are no restrictions on any of the variables, including what
     variables may occur in wff ` ph ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

  $( Axiom of Existence.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of
     predicate calculus with equality.  This axiom tells us is that at least
     one thing exists.  In this form (not requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be
     distinct) it was used in an axiom system of Tarski (see Axiom B7' in
     footnote 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 81.)  It is equivalent to axiom scheme
     C10' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint); the equivalence is
     established by ~ ax9o and ~ ax9from9o .  A more convenient form of this
     axiom is ~ a9e , which has additional remarks.

     Raph Levien proved the independence of this axiom from the other logical
     axioms on 12-Apr-2005.  See item 16 at
     ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html .

     ~ ax-9 can be proved from the weaker version ~ ax9v requiring that the
     variables be distinct; see theorem ~ ax9 .

     ~ ax-9 can also be proved from the Axiom of Separation (in the form that
     we use that axiom, where free variables are not universally quantified).
     See theorem ax9vsep in set.mm.

     Except by ~ ax9v , this axiom should not be referenced directly.  Instead,

       by adding a distinct variable restriction.  From here on, ~ ax-9 should
       not be referenced directly by any other proof, so that theorem ~ ax9
       will show that we can recover ~ ax-9 from this weaker version if it were
       an axiom (as it is in the case of Tarski).

       Note:  Introducing ` x y ` as a distinct variable group "out of the
       blue" with no apparent justification has puzzled some people, but it is
       perfectly sound.  All we are doing is adding an additional redundant
       requirement, no different from adding a redundant logical hypothesis,
       that results in a weakening of the theorem.  This means that any

  $( Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of
     predicate calculus with equality.  This is similar to, but not quite, a
     transitive law for equality (proved later as ~ equtr ).  This axiom scheme
     is a sub-scheme of Axiom Scheme B8 of system S2 of [Tarski], p. 75, whose
     general form cannot be represented with our notation.  Also appears as
     Axiom C7 of [Monk2] p. 105 and Axiom Scheme C8' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16
     of the preprint).

     The equality symbol was invented in 1527 by Robert Recorde.  He chose a
     pair of parallel lines of the same length because "noe .2. thynges, can be
     moare equalle."

     Note that this axiom is still valid even when any two or all three of
     ` x ` , ` y ` , and ` z ` are replaced with the same variable since they
     do not have any distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Because
     of this, we say that these three variables are "bundled" (a term coined by
     Raph Levien).  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

       ~ wceq of set theory, so that we don't "overload" the ` e. ` connective
       with two syntax definitions.  This is done to prevent ambiguity that
       would complicate some Metamath parsers.  The class variables ` A ` and
       ` B ` are introduced temporarily for the purpose of this definition but
       otherwise not used in predicate calculus.  See ~ df-clab for more
       information on the set theory usage of ~ wcel .) $)

     or " ` y ` contains ` x ` ."  Note:  The phrase " ` y ` includes
     ` x ` " means " ` x ` is a subset of ` y ` ;" to use it also for
     ` x e. y ` , as some authors occasionally do, is poor form and causes
     confusion, according to George Boolos (1992 lecture at MIT).

     This syntactical construction introduces a binary non-logical predicate
     symbol ` e. ` (epsilon) into our predicate calculus.  We will eventually
     use it for the membership predicate of set theory, but that is irrelevant
     at this point: the predicate calculus axioms for ` e. ` apply to any
     arbitrary binary predicate symbol.  "Non-logical" means that the predicate
     is presumed to have additional properties beyond the realm of predicate
     calculus, although these additional properties are not specified by
     predicate calculus itself but rather by the axioms of a theory (in our
     case set theory) added to predicate calculus.  "Binary" means that the
     predicate has two arguments.

     (Instead of introducing ~ wel as an axiomatic statement, as was done in an
     older version of this database, we introduce it by "proving" a special
     case of set theory's more general ~ wcel .  This lets us avoid overloading
     the ` e. ` connective, thus preventing ambiguity that would complicate

      Logical redundancy of ax-6 , ax-7 , ax-11 , ax-12
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The orginal axiom schemes of Tarski's predicate calculus are ~ ax-5 ,
  ~ ax-17 , ~ ax9v , ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-13 , and ~ ax-14 , together with rule
  ~ ax-gen .  See ~ http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html#compare .  They
  are given as axiom schemes B4 through B8 in [KalishMontague] p. 81.  These
  are shown to be logically complete by Theorem 1 of [KalishMontague] p. 85.

  The axiom system of set.mm includes the auxiliary axiom schemes ~ ax-6 ,
  ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-12 , and ~ ax-11 , which are not part of Tarski's axiom
  schemes.  They are used (and we conjecture are required) to make our system
  "metalogically complete" i.e. able to prove directly all possible schemes
  with wff and setvar metavariables, bundled or not, whose object-language
  instances are valid.  ( ~ ax-11 has been proved to be required; see
  ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html#9a .  Metalogical independence of the
  other three are open problems.)

  (There are additional predicate calculus axiom schemes included in set.mm
  such as ~ ax-4 , but they can all be proved as theorems from the above.)

  Terminology:  Two setvar (individual) metavariables are "bundled" in an axiom
  or theorem scheme when there is no distinct variable constraint ($d) imposed
  on them.  (The term "bundled" is due to Raph Levien.)  For example, the ` x `
  and ` y ` in ~ ax9 are bundled, but they are not in ~ ax9v . We also say that
  a scheme is bundled when it has at least one pair of bundled setvar
  metavariables.  If distinct variable conditions are added to all setvar
  metavariable pairs in a bundled scheme, we call that the "principal" instance
  of the bundled scheme.  For example, ~ ax9v is the principal instance of
  ~ ax9 . Whenever a common variable is substituted for two or more bundled
  variables in an axiom or theorem scheme, we call the substitution instance
  "degenerate".  For example, the instance ` -. A. x -. x = x ` of ~ ax9 is
  degenerate.  An advantage of bundling is ease of use since there are fewer
  distinct variable restrictions ($d) to be concerned with.  There is also a
  small economy in being able to state principal and degenerate instances
  simultaneously.  A disadvantage is that bundling may present difficulties in
  translations to other proof languages, which typically lack the concept (in
  part because their variables often represent the variables of the object
  language rather than metavariables ranging over them).

  Because Tarski's axiom schemes are logically complete, they can be used to
  prove any object-language instance of ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-11 , and ~ ax-12
  . "Translating" this to Metamath, it means that Tarski's axioms can prove any
  substitution instance of ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-11 , or ~ ax-12 in which (1)
  there are no wff metavariables and (2) all setvr metavariables are mutually
  distinct i.e. are not bundled.  In effect this is mimicking the object
  language by pretending that each setvar metavariable is an object-language
  variable.  (There may also be specific instances with wff metavariables
  and/or bundling that are directly provable from Tarski's axiom schemes, but
  it isn't guaranteed.  Whether all of them are possible is part of the still
  open metalogical independence problem for our additional axiom schemes.)

  It can be useful to see how this can be done, both to show that our
  additional schemes are valid metatheorems of Tarski's system and to be able
  to translate object language instances of our proofs into proofs that would
  work with a system using only Tarski's original schemes.  In addition, it may
  (or may not) provide insight into the conjectured metalogical independence of
  our additional schemes.

  The new theorem schemes ~ ax6w , ~ ax7w , ~ ax11w , and ~ ax12w are
  derived using only Tarski's axiom schemes, showing that Tarski's schemes can
  be used to derive all substitution instances of ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-11 ,
  and ~ ax-12 meeting conditions (1) and (2).  (The "w" suffix stands for "weak
  version".)  Each hypothesis of ~ ax6w , ~ ax7w , and ~ ax11w is of the
  form ` ( x = y -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) ` where ` ps ` is an auxiliary or "dummy"
  wff metavariable in which ` x ` doesn't occur.  We can show by induction on
  formula length that the hypotheses can be eliminated in all cases meeting
  conditions (1) and (2).  The example ~ ax11wdemo illustrates the techniques
  (equality theorems and bound variable renaming) used to achieve this.

  We also show the degenerate instances for axioms with bundled variables in
  ~ ax7dgen , ~ ax11dgen , ~ ax12dgen1 , ~ ax12dgen2 , ~ ax12dgen3 , and
  ~ ax12dgen4 . (Their proofs are trivial, but we include them to be thorough.)
  Combining the principal and degenerate cases _outside_ of Metamath, we show
  that the bundled schemes ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-11 , and ~ ax-12 are schemes
  of Tarski's system, meaning that all object language instances they generate
  are theorems of Tarski's system.

  It is interesting that Tarski used the bundled scheme ~ ax-9 in an older
  system, so it seems the main purpose of his later ~ ax9v was just to show
  that the weaker unbundled form is sufficient rather than an aesthetic
  objection to bundled free and bound variables.  Since we adopt the
  bundled ~ ax-9 as our official axiom, we  show that the degenerate
  instance holds in ~ ax9dgen .

  The case of ~ sp is curious:  originally an axiom of Tarski's system, it
  was proved redundant by Lemma 9 of [KalishMontague] p. 86.  However, the
  proof is by induction on formula length, and the compact scheme form
  ` A. x ph -> ph ` apparently cannot be proved directly from Tarski's other
  axioms.  The best we can do seems to be ~ spw , again requiring
  substitution instances of ` ph ` that meet conditions (1) and (2) above.
  Note that our direct proof ~ sp requires ~ ax-11 , which is not part of
  Tarski's system.

   Predicate calculus with equality:  Auxiliary axiom schemes (4 schemes)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  In this section we introduce four additional schemes ~ ax-6 , ~ ax-7 ,
  ~ ax-11 , and ~ ax-12 that are not part of Tarski's system but can be proved
  (outside of Metamath) as theorem schemes of Tarski's system.  These are
  needed to give our system the property of "metalogical completeness," which
  means that we can prove (with Metamath) all possible schemes expressible in
  our language of wff metavariables ranging over object-language wffs and
  setvar metavariables ranging over object-language individual variables.

  To show that these schemes are valid metatheorems of Tarski's system S2,
  above we proved from Tarski's system theorems ~ ax6w , ~ ax7w , ~ ax12w ,
  and ~ ax11w , which show that any object-language instance of these schemes
  (emulated by having no wff metavariables and requiring all setvar
  metavariables to be mutually distinct) can be proved using only the schemes
  in Tarski's system S2.

  An open problem is to show that these four additional schemes are
  metalogically independent from Tarski's.  So far, independence of ~ ax-11
  from all others has been shown, and independence of Tarski's ~ ax-9 from all
  others has been shown.

           Axiom scheme ax-11 (Substitution)

  $( Axiom of Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate
     calculus.  The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of
     expressing " ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` " (cf. ~ sb6 ).  It
     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,
     from which it can be proved by cases.

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-11o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-11 in Jan. 2007.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax11o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from
     ~ ax-11o as theorem ~ ax11 .

     Juha Arpiainen proved the metalogical independence of this axiom (in the
     form of the older axiom ~ ax-11o ) from the others on 19-Jan-2006.  See
     item 9a at ~ http://us.metamath.org/award2003.html .

     See ~ ax11v and ~ ax11v2 for other equivalents of this axiom that (unlike
     this axiom) have distinct variable restrictions.

     This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax11w ) but is used as an
     auxiliary axiom to achieve metalogical completeness.  (Contributed by NM,
     22-Jan-2007.) $)

       defined in the last paragraph on p. 77).  Also appears as Axiom scheme
       C5' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).

       For the axiom of specialization presented in many logic textbooks, see
       theorem ~ stdpc4 .

       This theorem shows that our obsolete axiom ~ ax-4 can be derived from
       the others.  The proof uses ideas from the proof of Lemma 21 of [Monk2]
       p. 114.

       It appears that this scheme cannot be derived directly from Tarski's
       axioms without auxiliary axiom scheme ~ ax-11 .  It is thought the best
       we can do using only Tarski's axioms is ~ spw .  (Contributed by NM,

       [Mendelson] p. 69.  The hypothesis ` F/ x ph ` can be thought of as
       emulating " ` x ` is not free in ` ph ` ."  With this definition, the
       meaning of "not free" is less restrictive than the usual textbook
       definition; for example ` x ` would not (for us) be free in ` x = x ` by
       ~ nfequid .  This theorem scheme can be proved as a metatheorem of
       Mendelson's axiom system, even though it is slightly stronger than his
       Axiom 5.  (Contributed by NM, 22-Sep-1993.)  (Revised by Mario Carneiro,

  $( Axiom of Quantified Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms
     of predicate calculus with equality.

     An equivalent way to express this axiom that may be easier to understand
     is ` ( -. x = y -> ( -. x = z -> ( y = z -> A. x y = z ) ) ) ` (see
     ~ ax12b ).  Recall that in the intended interpretation, our variables are
     metavariables ranging over the variables of predicate calculus (the object
     language).  In order for the first antecedent ` -. x = y ` to hold, ` x `
     and ` y ` must have different values and thus cannot be the same
     object-language variable.  Similarly, ` x ` and ` z ` cannot be the same
     object-language variable.  Therefore, ` x ` will not occur in the wff
     ` y = z ` when the first two antecedents hold, so analogous to ~ ax-17 ,
     the conclusion ` ( y = z -> A. x y = z ) ` follows.

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-12o and was replaced with this
     shorter ~ ax-12 in December 2015.  The old axiom is proved from this one
     as theorem ~ ax12o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from ~ ax-12o as
     theorem ~ ax12 .

     The primary purpose of this axiom is to provide a way to introduce the
     quantifier ` A. x ` on ` y = z ` even when ` x ` and ` y ` are substituted
     with the same variable.  In this case, the first antecedent becomes
     ` -. x = x ` and the axiom still holds.

     Although this version is shorter, the original version ~ ax12o may be more
     practical to work with because of the "distinctor" form of its
     antecedents.  A typical application of ~ ax12o is in ~ dvelimh which
     converts a distinct variable pair to the distinctor antecendent
     ` -. A. x x = y ` .

     This axiom can be weakened if desired by adding distinct variable
     restrictions on pairs ` x , z ` and ` y , z ` .  To show that, we add
     these restrictions to theorem ~ ax12v and use only ~ ax12v for further
     derivations.  Thus, ~ ax12v should be the only theorem referencing this
     axiom.  Other theorems can reference either ~ ax12v or ~ ax12o .

     This axiom scheme is logically redundant (see ~ ax12w ) but is used as an
     auxiliary axiom to achieve metalogical completeness.  (Contributed by NM,
     21-Dec-2015.)  (New usage is discouraged.) $)

       domains of discourse) and "protect" the consequent.

  Predicate calculus with equality:  Older axiomatization (1 rule, 14 schemes)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

  The "metalogical completeness theorem", Theorem 9.7 of [Megill] p. 448, uses
  a different but (logically and metalogically) equivalent set of axiom schemes
  for its proof.  In order to show that our axiomatization is also
  metalogically complete, we derive the axiom schemes of that paper in this
  section (or mention where they are derived, if they have already been derived
  as therorems above).  Additionally, we re-derive our axiomatization from the
  one in the paper, showing that the two systems are equivalent.

  The 14 predicate calculus axioms used by the paper are ~ ax-5o , ~ ax-4 ,
  ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-6o , ~ ax-8 , ~ ax-12o , ~ ax-9o , ~ ax-10o , ~ ax-13 ,
  ~ ax-14 , ~ ax-15 , ~ ax-11o , ~ ax-16 , and ~ ax-17 .  Like ours, it
  includes the rule of generalization ( ~ ax-gen ).

  The ones we need to prove from our axioms are ~ ax-5o , ~ ax-4 ,
  ~ ax-6o , ~ ax-12o , ~ ax-9o , ~ ax-10o , ~ ax-15 , ~ ax-11o ,
  and ~ ax-16 . The theorems showing the derivations of those axioms,
  which have all been proved earlier, are ~ ax5o , ~ ax4 (also called
  ~ sp ), ~ ax6o , ~ ax12o , ~ ax9o , ~ ax10o , ~ ax15 , ~ ax11o ,
  ~ ax16 , and ~ ax10 . In addition, ~ ax-10 was an intermediate axiom we
  adopted at one time, and we show its proof in this section as
  ~ ax10from10o .

  This section also includes a few miscellaneous legacy theorems such as
  ~ hbequid use the older axioms.

  Note:  The axioms and theorems in this section should not be used outside of
  this section.  Inside this section, we may use the external axioms ~ ax-gen ,

  $( Axiom of Specialization.  A quantified wff implies the wff without a
     quantifier (i.e. an instance, or special case, of the generalized wff).
     In other words if something is true for all ` x ` , it is true for any
     specific ` x ` (that would typically occur as a free variable in the wff
     substituted for ` ph ` ).  (A free variable is one that does not occur in
     the scope of a quantifier: ` x ` and ` y ` are both free in ` x = y ` ,
     but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .)  This is one of the axioms of
     what we call "pure" predicate calculus ( ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-7 plus rule
     ~ ax-gen ).  Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).
     Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski] p. 67 (under his system S2, defined
     in the last paragraph on p. 77).

     Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a
     weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule
     ~ ax-gen .  Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-12 ,
     ~ ax-15 , ~ ax-16 , and ~ ax-17 .

     Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose
     a variable different from ` x ` for the special case.  For use, that
     requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later
     after we introduce the definition of proper substitution - see ~ stdpc4 .

     An interesting alternate axiomatization uses ~ ax467 and ~ ax-5o in place
     of ~ ax-4 , ~ ax-5 , ~ ax-6 , and ~ ax-7 .

  $( Axiom of Quantified Implication.  This axiom moves a quantifier from
     outside to inside an implication, quantifying ` ps ` .  Notice that ` x `
     must not be a free variable in the antecedent of the quantified
     implication, and we express this by binding ` ph ` to "protect" the axiom
     from a ` ph ` containing a free ` x ` .  One of the 4 axioms of "pure"
     predicate calculus.  Axiom scheme C4' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-10o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from
     ~ ax-10o as theorem ~ ax10from10o .

     This axiom was proved redundant in July 2015.  See theorem ~ ax10 .

  $( Axiom ~ ax-11o ("o" for "old") was the original version of ~ ax-11 ,
     before it was discovered (in Jan. 2007) that the shorter ~ ax-11 could
     replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of
     the preprint).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of
     [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this
     theorem more easily, think of " ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ..." as informally
     meaning "if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then..."  The
     antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and
     ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some
     later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a
     "distinctor."

     Interestingly, if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no
     wff variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking
     this axiom.  This means that even though this axiom is _metalogically_
     independent from the others, it is not _logically_ independent.
     Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of axiom
     ~ ax-11o (from which the ~ ax-11 instance follows by theorem ~ ax11 .)
     The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax11eq and ~ ax11el
     for the basis steps and ~ ax11indn , ~ ax11indi , and ~ ax11inda for the
     induction steps.  (This paragraph is true provided we use ~ ax-10o in
     place of ~ ax-10 .)

     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that
     whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true,
     then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z `
     is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill]

       16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear in the
       literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by

               Aristotelian logic: Assertic syllogisms
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Model the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms using modern notation.
  This section shows that the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms can be proven
  with our axioms of logic, and also provides generally useful theorems.

  In antiquity Aristotelian logic and Stoic logic
  (see ~ mpto1 ) were the leading logical systems.
  Aristotelian logic became the leading system in medieval Europe;
  this section models this system (including later refinements to it).
  Aristotle defined syllogisms very generally
  ("a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed,
  something different from the things supposed results of necessity
  because these things are so")
  Aristotle, _Prior Analytics_ 24b18-20.
  However, in _Prior Analytics_ he limits himself to
  categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions
  with specific structures.  The syllogisms are the valid subset of
  the possible combinations of these structures.
  The medieval schools used vowels to identify the types of terms
  (a=all, e=none, i=some, and o=some are not), and named the different
  syllogisms with Latin words that had the vowels in the intended order.

  "There is a surprising amount of scholarly debate
  about how best to formalize Aristotle's syllogisms..." according to
  _Aristotle's Modal Proofs: Prior Analytics A8-22 in Predicate Logic_,

  For example, Lukasiewicz believes it is important to note that
  "Aristotle does not introduce singular terms or premisses into his system".
  Lukasiewicz also believes that Aristotelian syllogisms are
  predicates (having a true/false value), not inference rules:
  "The characteristic sign of an inference is the word 'therefore'...
  no syllogism is formulated by Aristotle primarily as an inference,
  but they are all implications."
  Jan Lukasiewicz, _Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of
  Modern Formal Logic_, Second edition, Oxford, 1957, page 1-2.
  Lukasiewicz devised a specialized prefix notation for representing
  Aristotelian syllogisms instead of using standard predicate logic notation.

  We instead translate each Aristotelian syllogism into an inference rule,
  and each rule is defined using standard predicate logic notation and
  predicates.  The predicates are represented by wff variables
  that may depend on the quantified variable ` x ` .
  Our translation is essentially identical to the one
  use in Rini page 18, Table 2 "Non-Modal Syllogisms in
  Lower Predicate Calculus (LPC)", which uses
  standard predicate logic with predicates.  Rini states,
  "the crucial point is that we capture the meaning Aristotle intends,
  and the method by which we represent that meaning is less important."
  There are two differences: we make the existence criteria explicit, and
  we use ` ph ` , ` ps ` , and ` ch ` in the order they appear
  (a common Metamath convention).
  Patzig also uses standard predicate logic notation and predicates
  (though he interprets them as conditional propositions, not as
  inference rules); see
  Gunther Patzig, _Aristotle's Theory of the Syllogism_ second edition, 1963,
  English translation by Jonathan Barnes, 1968, page 38.
  Terms such as "all" and "some" are translated into predicate logic
  using the aproach devised by Frege and Russell.
  "Frege (and Russell) devised an ingenious procedure for regimenting
  binary quantifiers like "every" and "some" in terms of unary quantifiers
  like "everything" and "something": they formalized sentences of the form
  "Some A is B" and "Every A is B" as
  exists x (Ax and Bx) and all x (Ax implies Bx), respectively."
  "Quantifiers and Quantification", _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_,
  ~ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantification/ .
  See _Principia Mathematica_ page 22 and *10 for more information
  (especially *10.3 and *10.26).

  Expressions of the form "no ` ph ` is ` ps ` " are consistently translated as
  ` A. x ( ph -> -. ps ) ` .  These can also be expressed as
  ` -. E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , per ~ alinexa .
  We translate "all ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` A. x ( ph -> ps ) ` ,
  "some ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , and
  "some ` ph ` is not ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ -. ps ) ` .
  It is traditional to use the singular verb "is", not the plural
  verb "are", in the generic expressions.
  By convention the major premise is listed first.

  In traditional Aristotelian syllogisms the predicates
  have a restricted form ("x is a ..."); those predicates
  could be modeled in modern notation by constructs such as
  ` x = A ` , ` x e. A ` , or ` x C_ A ` .
  Here we use wff variables instead of specialized restricted forms.
  This generalization makes the syllogisms more useful
  in more circumstances.  In addition, these expressions make
  it clearer that the syllogisms of Aristolean logic are the
  forerunners of predicate calculus.  If we used restricted forms
  like ` x e. A ` instead, we would not only unnecessarily limit
  their use, but we would also need to use set and class axioms,
  making their relationship to predicate calculus less clear.

  There are some widespread misconceptions about the existential
  assumptions made by Aristotle (aka "existential import").
  Aristotle was not trying to develop something exactly corresponding
  to modern logic.  Aristotle devised "a companion-logic for science.
  He relegates fictions like fairy godmothers and mermaids and unicorns to
  the realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the
  ambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent
  entities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent
  omission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,
  where a definition is "a phrase signifying a thing's essence."
  (Topics, I.5.102a37, Pickard-Cambridge.)...
  Because non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in
  Aristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves
  no place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns)."

  section 7. (Existential Assumptions),
  _Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ (A Peer-Reviewed Academic Resource),
  ~ http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ .
  Thus, some syllogisms have "extra" existence
  hypotheses that do not directly appear in Aristotle's original materials
  (since they were always assumed); they are added where they are needed.
  This affects ~ barbari , ~ celaront , ~ cesaro , ~ camestros , ~ felapton ,
  ~ darapti , ~ calemos , ~ fesapo , and ~ bamalip .

  These are only the _assertic_ syllogisms.
  Aristotle also defined modal syllogisms that deal with modal
  qualifiers such as "necessarily" and "possibly".
  Historically Aristotelian modal syllogisms were not as widely used.
  For more about modal syllogisms in a modern context, see Rini as well as
  _Aristotle's Modal Syllogistic_ by Marko Malink, Harvard
  University Press, November 2013.  We do not treat them further here.

  Aristotelean logic is essentially the forerunner of predicate calculus
  (as well as set theory since it discusses membership in groups),
  while Stoic logic is essentially the forerunner of propositional calculus.

Intuitionistic (constructive) logic is similar to classical logic
with the notable omission of ~ ax-3 and theorems such as ~ exmid or
~ peirce . We mostly treat intuitionistic logic in a separate file, iset.mm,
which is known as the Intuitionistic Logic Explorer on the web site. However,
iset.mm has a number of additional axioms (mainly to replace definitions like
~ df-or and ~ df-ex which are not valid in intitionistic logic) and we want
to prove those axioms here to demonstrate that adding those axioms in iset.mm
does not make iset.mm any less consistent than set.mm.

                NEW FOUNDATIONS (NF) SET THEORY
###############################################################################

Here we introduce New Foundations set theory.
We first introduce the axiom of extensionality in ~ ax-ext .
We later add set construction axioms from
Hailperin, such as ~ ax-nin ,
that are designed to implement the
Stratification Axiom from Quine.

We then introduce ordered pairs, relationships, and functions.
Note that the definition of an ordered pair (in ~ df-op ) is different
than the Kuratowski ordered pair definition (in ~ df-opk )
typically used in ZFC, because the Kuratowski definition is not type-level.

We conclude with orderings.

    $( Axiom of Extensionality.  An axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  It
       states that two sets are identical if they contain the same elements.
       Axiom Ext of [BellMachover] p. 461.

       Set theory can also be formulated with a _single_ primitive predicate
       ` e. ` on top of traditional predicate calculus _without_ equality.  In
       that case the Axiom of Extensionality becomes
       ` ( A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) -> ( x e. z -> y e. z ) ) ` , and
       equality ` x = y ` is _defined_ as ` A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) ` .  All
       of the usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory.
       See, for example, Axiom 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 8.

       To use the above "equality-free" version of Extensionality with
       Metamath's logical axioms, we would rewrite ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 with
       equality expanded according to the above definition.  Some of those
       axioms could be proved from set theory and would be redundant.  Not all
       of them are redundant, since our axioms of predicate calculus make
       essential use of equality for the proper substitution that is a
       primitive notion in traditional predicate calculus.  A study of such an
       axiomatization would be an interesting project for someone exploring the
       foundations of logic.

       _General remarks_:  Our set theory axioms are presented using defined
       connectives ( ` <-> ` , ` E. ` , etc.) for convenience.  However, it is
       implicitly understood that the actual axioms use only the primitive
       connectives ` -> ` , ` -. ` , ` A. ` , ` = ` , and ` e. ` .  It is
       straightforward to establish the equivalence between the actual axioms
       and the ones we display, and we will not do so.

       It is important to understand that strictly speaking, all of our set
       theory axioms are really schemes that represent an infinite number of
       actual axioms.  This is inherent in the design of Metamath
       ("metavariable math"), which manipulates only metavariables.  For
       example, the metavariable ` x ` in ~ ax-ext can represent any actual
       variable _v1_, _v2_, _v3_,... .  Distinct variable restrictions ($d)
       prevent us from substituting say _v1_ for both ` x ` and ` z ` .  This
       is in contrast to typical textbook presentations that present actual
       axioms (except for ZFC Replacement ax-rep in set.mm, which involves a
       wff metavariable).  In practice, though, the theorems and proofs are
       essentially the same.  The $d restrictions make each of the infinite
       axioms generated by the ~ ax-ext scheme exactly logically equivalent to
       each other and in particular to the actual axiom of the textbook
       version.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

  $( Define class abstraction notation (so-called by Quine), also called a
     "class builder" in the literature. ` x ` and ` y ` need not be distinct.
     Definition 2.1 of [Quine] p. 16.  Typically, ` ph ` will have ` y ` as a
     free variable, and " ` { y | ph } ` " is read "the class of all sets ` y `
     such that ` ph ( y ) ` is true."  We do not define ` { y | ph } ` in
     isolation but only as part of an expression that extends or "overloads"
     the ` e. ` relationship.

     This is our first use of the ` e. ` symbol to connect classes instead of
     sets.  The syntax definition ~ wcel , which extends or "overloads" the
     ~ wel definition connecting setvar variables, requires that both sides of
     ` e. ` be a class.  In ~ df-cleq and ~ df-clel , we introduce a new kind
     of variable (class variable) that can substituted with expressions such as
     ` { y | ph } ` .  In the present definition, the ` x ` on the left-hand
     side is a setvar variable.  Syntax definition ~ cv allows us to substitute
     a setvar variable ` x ` for a class variable: all sets are classes by
     ~ cvjust (but not necessarily vice-versa).  For a full description of how
     classes are introduced and how to recover the primitive language, see the
     discussion in Quine (and under ~ abeq2 for a quick overview).

     Because class variables can be substituted with compound expressions and
     setvar variables cannot, it is often useful to convert a theorem
     containing a free setvar variable to a more general version with a class
     variable.  This is done with theorems such as ~ vtoclg which is used, for
     example, to convert elirrv in set.mm to elirr in set.mm.

     This is called the "axiom of class comprehension" by [Levy] p. 338, who
     treats the theory of classes as an extralogical extension to our logic and
     set theory axioms.  He calls the construction ` { y | ph } ` a "class
     term".

    $( Define the equality connective between classes.  Definition 2.7 of
       [Quine] p. 18.  Also Definition 4.5 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13; Chapter 4
       provides its justification and methods for eliminating it.  Note that
       its elimination will not necessarily result in a single wff in the
       original language but possibly a "scheme" of wffs.

       This is an example of a somewhat "risky" definition, meaning that it has
       a more complex than usual soundness justification (outside of Metamath),
       because it "overloads" or reuses the existing equality symbol rather
       than introducing a new symbol.  This allows us to make statements that
       may not hold for the original symbol.  For example, it permits us to
       deduce ` y = z <-> A. x ( x e. y <-> x e. z ) ` , which is not a theorem
       of logic but rather presupposes the Axiom of Extensionality (see theorem
       ~ axext4 ).  We therefore include this axiom as a hypothesis, so that
       the use of Extensionality is properly indicated.

       We could avoid this complication by introducing a new symbol, say =_2,
       in place of ` = ` .  This would also have the advantage of making
       elimination of the definition straightforward, so that we could
       eliminate Extensionality as a hypothesis.  We would then also have the
       advantage of being able to identify in various proofs exactly where
       Extensionality truly comes into play rather than just being an artifact
       of a definition.  One of our theorems would then be ` x ` =_2
       ` y <-> x = y ` by invoking Extensionality.

       However, to conform to literature usage, we retain this overloaded
       definition.  This also makes some proofs shorter and probably easier to
       read, without the constant switching between two kinds of equality.

       See also comments under ~ df-clab , ~ df-clel , and ~ abeq2 .

       In the form of ~ dfcleq , this is called the "axiom of extensionality"
       by [Levy] p. 338, who treats the theory of classes as an extralogical
       extension to our logic and set theory axioms.

       strengthen the set of valid wffs of logic when the class variables are
       replaced with setvar variables (see ~ cleljust ), so we don't include
       any set theory axiom as a hypothesis.  See also comments about the

    $( Equality of a class variable and a class abstraction (also called a
       class builder).  Theorem 5.1 of [Quine] p. 34.  This theorem shows the
       relationship between expressions with class abstractions and expressions
       with class variables.  Note that ~ abbi and its relatives are among
       those useful for converting theorems with class variables to equivalent
       theorems with wff variables, by first substituting a class abstraction
       for each class variable.

       Class variables can always be eliminated from a theorem to result in an
       equivalent theorem with wff variables, and vice-versa.  The idea is
       roughly as follows.  To convert a theorem with a wff variable ` ph `
       (that has a free variable ` x ` ) to a theorem with a class variable
       ` A ` , we substitute ` x e. A ` for ` ph ` throughout and simplify,
       where ` A ` is a new class variable not already in the wff.  An example
       is the conversion of zfauscl in set.mm to inex1 in set.mm (look at the
       instance of zfauscl that occurs in the proof of inex1 ).  Conversely, to
       convert a theorem with a class variable ` A ` to one with ` ph ` , we
       substitute ` { x | ph } ` for ` A ` throughout and simplify, where ` x `
       and ` ph ` are new setvar and wff variables not already in the wff.  An
       example is cp in set.mm , which derives a formula containing wff
       variables from substitution instances of the class variables in its
       equivalent formulation cplem2 in set.mm.  For more information on class
       variables, see Quine pp. 15-21 and/or Takeuti and Zaring pp. 10-13.

       exists (i.e. there exists some set ` x ` equal to class ` A ` ).
       Theorem 6.9 of [Quine] p. 43. _Notational convention_:  We will use the
       notational device " ` A e. _V ` " to mean " ` A ` is a set" very
       frequently, for example in ~ uniex .  Note the when ` A ` is not a set,
       it is called a proper class.  In some theorems, such as ~ uniexg , in
       order to shorten certain proofs we use the more general antecedent
       ` A e. V ` instead of ` A e. _V ` to mean " ` A ` is a set."

       Note that a constant is implicitly considered distinct from all
       variables.  This is why ` _V ` is not included in the distinct variable
       list, even though ~ df-clel requires that the expression substituted for
       ` B ` not contain ` x ` .  (Also, the Metamath spec does not allow

    $( Russell's Paradox.  Proposition 4.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14.

       In the late 1800s, Frege's Axiom of (unrestricted) Comprehension,
       expressed in our notation as ` A e. _V ` , asserted that any collection
       of sets ` A ` is a set i.e. belongs to the universe ` _V ` of all sets.
       In particular, by substituting ` { x | x e/ x } ` (the "Russell class")
       for ` A ` , it asserted ` { x | x e/ x } e. _V ` , meaning that the
       "collection of all sets which are not members of themselves" is a set.
       However, here we prove ` { x | x e/ x } e/ _V ` .  This contradiction
       was discovered by Russell in 1901 (published in 1903), invalidating the
       Comprehension Axiom and leading to the collapse of Frege's system.

       In 1908, Zermelo rectified this fatal flaw by replacing Comprehension
       with a weaker Subset (or Separation) Axiom ssex in set.mm asserting that
       ` A ` is a set only when it is smaller than some other set ` B ` .
       However, Zermelo was then faced with a "chicken and egg" problem of how
       to show ` B ` is a set, leading him to introduce the set-building axioms
       of Null Set ~ 0ex , Pairing ~ prex , Union ~ uniex , Power Set ~ pwex ,
       and Infinity omex in set.mm to give him some starting sets to work with
       (all of which, before Russell's Paradox, were immediate consequences of
       Frege's Comprehension).  In 1922 Fraenkel strengthened the Subset Axiom
       with our present Replacement Axiom funimaex in set.mm (whose modern
       formalization is due to Skolem, also in 1922).  Thus, in a very real
       sense Russell's Paradox spawned the invention of ZF set theory and
       completely revised the foundations of mathematics!

       Another mainstream formalization of set theory, devised by von Neumann,
       Bernays, and Goedel, uses class variables rather than setvar variables
       as its primitives.  The axiom system NBG in [Mendelson] p. 225 is
       suitable for a Metamath encoding.  NBG is a conservative extension of ZF
       in that it proves exactly the same theorems as ZF that are expressible
       in the language of ZF. An advantage of NBG is that it is finitely
       axiomatizable - the Axiom of Replacement can be broken down into a
       finite set of formulas that eliminate its wff metavariable.  Finite
       axiomatizability is required by some proof languages (although not by
       Metamath).  There is a stronger version of NBG called Morse-Kelley
       (axiom system MK in [Mendelson] p. 287).

       Russell himself continued in a different direction, avoiding the paradox
       with his "theory of types."  Quine extended Russell's ideas to formulate
       his New Foundations set theory (axiom system NF of [Quine] p. 331).  In
       NF, the collection of all sets is a set, contradicting ZF and NBG set
       theories, and it has other bizarre consequences: when sets become too
       huge (beyond the size of those used in standard mathematics), the Axiom
       of Choice ac4 in set.mm and Cantor's Theorem canth in set.mm are
       provably false!  (See ncanth in set.mm for some intuition behind the
       latter.)  Recent results (as of 2014) seem to show that NF is
       equiconsistent to Z (ZF in which ax-sep in set.mm replaces ax-rep in
       set.mm) with ax-sep restricted to only bounded quantifiers.  NF is
       finitely axiomatizable and can be encoded in Metamath using the axioms
       from T. Hailperin, "A set of axioms for logic," _J. Symb.  Logic_ 9:1-19
       (1944).

       Under ZF set theory, every set is a member of the Russell class by
       elirrv in set.mm (derived from the Axiom of Regularity), so for us the
       Russell class equals the universe ` _V ` (theorem ruv in set.mm).  See
       ruALT in set.mm for an alternate proof of ~ ru derived from that fact.

  $( Define the proper substitution of a class for a set.

     When ` A ` is a proper class, our definition evaluates to false.  This is
     somewhat arbitrary: we could have, instead, chosen the conclusion of
     ~ sbc6 for our definition, which always evaluates to true for proper
     classes.

     Our definition also does not produce the same results as discussed in the
     proof of Theorem 6.6 of [Quine] p. 42 (although Theorem 6.6 itself does
     hold, as shown by ~ dfsbcq below).  For example, if ` A ` is a proper
     class, Quine's substitution of ` A ` for ` y ` in 0 ` e. y ` evaluates to
     0 ` e. A ` rather than our falsehood.  (This can be seen by substituting
     ` A ` , ` y ` , and 0 for alpha, beta, and gamma in Subcase 1 of Quine's
     discussion on p. 42.)  Unfortunately, Quine's definition requires a
     recursive syntactical breakdown of ` ph ` , and it does not seem possible
     to express it with a single closed formula.

     If we did not want to commit to any specific proper class behavior, we
     could use this definition _only_ to prove theorem ~ dfsbcq , which holds
     for both our definition and Quine's, and from which we can derive a weaker
     version of ~ df-sbc in the form of ~ sbc8g .  However, the behavior of
     Quine's definition at proper classes is similarly arbitrary, and for
     practical reasons (to avoid having to prove sethood of ` A ` in every use
     of this definition) we allow direct reference to ~ df-sbc and assert that
     ` [. A / x ]. ph ` is always false when ` A ` is a proper class.

     The theorem ~ sbc2or shows the apparently "strongest" statement we can
     make regarding behavior at proper classes if we start from ~ dfsbcq .

     The related definition ~ df-csb defines proper substitution into a class
     variable (as opposed to a wff variable).  (Contributed by NM,

  $( This theorem, which is similar to Theorem 6.7 of [Quine] p. 42 and holds
     under both our definition and Quine's, provides us with a weak definition
     of the proper substitution of a class for a set.  Since our ~ df-sbc does
     not result in the same behavior as Quine's for proper classes, if we
     wished to avoid conflict with Quine's definition we could start with this
     theorem and ~ dfsbcq2 instead of ~ df-sbc .  ( ~ dfsbcq2 is needed because
     unlike Quine we do not overload the ~ df-sb syntax.)  As a consequence of
     these theorems, we can derive ~ sbc8g , which is a weaker version of
     ~ df-sbc that leaves substitution undefined when ` A ` is a proper class.

     However, it is often a nuisance to have to prove the sethood hypothesis of
     ~ sbc8g , so we will allow direct use of ~ df-sbc after theorem ~ sbc2or
     below.  Proper substiution with a proper class is rarely needed, and when
     it is, we can simply use the expansion of Quine's definition.

           "Weak deduction theorem" for set theory
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  In a Hilbert system of logic (which consists of a set of axioms, modus
  ponens, and the generalization rule), converting a deduction to a proof using
  the Deduction Theorem (taught in introductory logic books) involves an
  exponential increase of the number of steps as hypotheses are successively
  eliminated.  Here is a trick that is not as general as the Deduction Theorem
  but requires only a linear increase in the number of steps.

  The general problem:  We want to convert a deduction
    P |- Q
  into a proof of the theorem
    |- P -> Q
  i.e. we want to eliminate the hypothesis P.  Normally this is done using the
  Deduction (meta)Theorem, which looks at the microscopic steps of the
  deduction and usually doubles or triples the number of these microscopic
  steps for each hypothesis that is eliminated.  We will look at a special case
  of this problem, without appealing to the Deduction Theorem.

  We assume ZF with class notation.  A and B are arbitrary (possibly
  proper) classes.  P, Q, R, S and T are wffs.

  We define the conditional operator, if(P,A,B), as follows:
    if(P,A,B) =def= { x | (x \in A & P) v (x \in B & -. P) }
  (where x does not occur in A, B, or P).

  Lemma 1.
    A = if(P,A,B) -> (P <-> R), B = if(P,A,B) -> (S <-> R), S |- R
  Proof:  Logic and Axiom of Extensionality.

  Lemma 2.
    A = if(P,A,B) -> (Q <-> T), T |- P -> Q
  Proof:  Logic and Axiom of Extensionality.

  Here's a simple example that illustrates how it works.  Suppose we have
  a deduction
    Ord A |- Tr A
  which means, "Assume A is an ordinal class.  Then A is a transitive class."
  Note that A is a class variable that may be substituted with any class
  expression, so this is really a deduction scheme.

  We want to convert this to a proof of the theorem (scheme)
    |- Ord A -> Tr A.

  The catch is that we must be able to prove "Ord A" for at least one
  object A (and this is what makes it weaker than the ordinary Deduction
  Theorem).  However, it is easy to prove |- Ord 0 (the empty set is
  ordinal).  (For a typical textbook "theorem," i.e. deduction, there is
  usually at least one object satisfying each hypothesis, otherwise the
  theorem would not be very useful.  We can always go back to the standard
  Deduction Theorem for those hypotheses where this is not the case.)
  Continuing with the example:

  Equality axioms (and Extensionality) yield
    |- A = if(Ord A, A, 0) -> (Ord A <-> Ord if(Ord A, A, 0))  (1)
    |- 0 = if(Ord A, A, 0) -> (Ord 0 <-> Ord if(Ord A, A, 0))  (2)
  From (1), (2) and |- Ord 0, Lemma 1 yields
    |- Ord if(Ord A, A, 0)                                       (3)
  From (3) and substituting if(Ord A, A, 0) for
  A in the original deduction,
    |- Tr if(Ord A, A, 0)                                        (4)
  Equality axioms (and Extensionality) yield
    |- A = if(Ord A, A, 0) -> (Tr A <-> Tr if(Ord A, A, 0))    (5)
  From (4) and (5), Lemma 2 yields
    |- Ord A -> Tr A                                               (Q.E.D.)

       formally but is implicit in informal definitions such as "let f(x)=0 if
       x=0 and 1/x otherwise."  (In older versions of this database, this
       operator was denoted "ded" and called the "deduction class.")

       An important use for us is in conjunction with the weak deduction
       theorem, which converts a hypothesis into an antecedent.  In that role,
       ` A ` is a class variable in the hypothesis and ` B ` is a class
       (usually a constant) that makes the hypothesis true when it is
       substituted for ` A ` .  See ~ dedth for the main part of the weak
       deduction theorem, ~ elimhyp to eliminate a hypothesis, and ~ keephyp to
       keep a hypothesis.  See the Deduction Theorem link on the Metamath Proof

       also let it apply to proper classes, i.e. those that are not members of
       ` _V ` .  When applied to a set, this produces its power set.  A power
       set of S is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S
       itself.  For example, if ` A = { ` 3 , 5 , 7 ` } ` , then
       ` ~P A = { (/) , { ` 3 ` } , { ` 5 ` } , { ` 7 ` } , { ` 3 , 5 ` } , `
       ` { ` 3 , 7 ` } , { ` 5 , 7 ` } , { ` 3 , 5 , 7 ` } } ` (ex-pw in

       set.mm, which can be expressed in class notation per ~ pwexg .  Still
       later we will prove, in hashpw in set.mm, that the size of the power set
       of a finite set is 2 raised to the power of the size of the set.

       required by the definition), and ` B ` depends on ` x ` i.e. can be read
       informally as ` B ( x ) ` .  We call ` x ` the index, ` A ` the index
       set, and ` B ` the indexed set.  In most books, ` x e. A ` is written as
       a subscript or underneath a union symbol ` U. ` .  We use a special
       union symbol ` U_ ` to make it easier to distinguish from plain class
       union.  In many theorems, you will see that ` x ` and ` A ` are in the
       same distinct variable group (meaning ` A ` cannot depend on ` x ` ) and
       that ` B ` and ` x ` do not share a distinct variable group (meaning
       that can be thought of as ` B ( x ) ` i.e. can be substituted with a

    $( State the axiom of anti-intersection.  Axiom P1 of [Hailperin] p. 6.
       This axiom sets up boolean operations on sets.

       Note on this and the following axioms: this axiom, ~ ax-xp , ~ ax-cnv ,
       ~ ax-1c , ~ ax-sset , ~ ax-si , ~ ax-ins2 , ~ ax-ins3 , and
       ~ ax-typlower are from Hailperin and are designed to implement the
       Stratification Axiom of Quine.

       A well-formed formula using only propositional symbols, predicate
       symbols, and ` e. ` is "stratified" iff you can make a (metalogical)
       mapping from the variables to the natural numbers such that any formulas
       of the form ` x = y ` have the same number, and any formulas of the form
       ` x e. y ` have ` x ` as one less than ` y ` .  Quine's stratification
       axiom states that there is a set corresponding to any stratified
       formula.

       Since we cannot state stratification from within the logic, we use
       Hailperin's axioms and prove existence of stratified sets using
       Hailperin's algorithm.  (Contributed by SF, 12-Jan-2015.) $)

     is well-defined, although not very meaningful, when classes ` A ` and/or

     find uses for this definition when ` F ` is a proper class. ` F ` is

       exponentiation operations (e.g.  Definition 10.42 of [TakeutiZaring]
       p. 95).  Other authors show ` B ` as a prefixed superscript, which is
       read " ` A ` pre ` B ` " (e.g. definition of [Enderton] p. 52).
       Definition 8.21 of [Eisenberg] p. 125 uses the notation Map( ` B ` ,
       ` A ` ) for our ` ( A ^m B ) ` .  The up-arrow is used by Donald Knuth
       for iterated exponentiation (_Science_ 194, 1235-1242, 1976).  We adopt
       the first case of his notation (simple exponentiation) and subscript it
       with _m_ to distinguish it from other kinds of exponentiation.
