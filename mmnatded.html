&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <B>deduction</B> (also called an <B>inference</B>) is a kind of
statement that needs some hypotheses to be true in order for its
conclusion to be true.  A <B>theorem</B>, on the other hand, has no
hypotheses (or all its hypotheses are definitions).
Informally we may call both of them theorems, but on this
page we will stick to the strict definition.

<P>
When being rigorous,
it is surprisingly complicated to convert some deduction in the form
<IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'
ALIGN=TOP> <IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'
ALIGN=TOP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC='bigto.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19
ALT='=&gt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10
HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'> <IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19
ALT='ta'>
into some theorem in the form
<IMG SRC='_vdash.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='|-'
ALIGN=TOP> <IMG SRC='lp.gif' WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=19 ALT='('><IMG
SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'> <IMG
SRC='to.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19 ALT='-&gt;'> <IMG
SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'><IMG SRC='rp.gif'
WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=19 ALT=')'>.
The deduction says,
"if we can prove
<IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'>
 then we can prove
<IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'>,&quot;
which is in some
sense weaker than saying
&quot;<IMG SRC='_sigma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='si'>
implies
<IMG SRC='_tau.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT='ta'>.&quot;
In particular, there is no axiom of logic that
permits us to directly obtain the theorem given the deduction.
The conversion of a deduction to a theorem does not even hold in general
for <A HREF="../qlegif/mmql.html#prop">quantum propositional calculus</A>,
which is a weak subset of classical propositional calculus.
It has been shown that adding the Standard Deduction Theorem
to quantum propositional calculus turns it into classical
propositional calculus!

<P>
This is in contrast to going the other way;
if we have the theorem, it is easy to recover the
deduction using modus ponens <A HREF="ax-mp.html">ax-mp</A>.
An example of this is the derivation of the inference
<A HREF="simpli.html">simpli</A> from the theorem <A
HREF="simpl.html">simpl</A>.

<P>
In traditional logic books, this is often resolved using a metatheorem
called the <B>Deduction Theorem</B> (discovered independently
by Herbrand and Tarski around 1930).
The deduction theorem, aka the standard deduction theorem,
provides an algorithm for constructing a proof of
a theorem from the proof of its corresponding deduction.
See, for example, Margaris, <I>First Order Mathematical Logic,</I> p. 56.
To construct a proof for a theorem, the deduction theorem's algorithm
looks at each step in the proof of the original deduction and rewrites
the step with several steps wherein the hypothesis is eliminated and
becomes an antecedent.
Ordinary mathematical proofs invoke this algorithm when converting
a deduction into a theorem.

<P>
However, in practice, no one actually carries out this conversion
algorithm in ordinary mathematics.
Instead, mathematicians often stop once they believe the conversion
algorithm could be done.
This sharply contrasts with Metamath's philosophical goal, which is
to show all proofs <I>directly</I> from
the axiom system in its database, and not skip steps or
rely on higher-level metatheorems derived outside of that axiom system.

<P>Metamath is capable of converting a hypothesis into an antecedent.
We have found that in many cases only a weakened form
of the deduction theorem is necessary,
called the <B>weak deduction theorem</B>
(<A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> and its variants).
The weak deduction theorem is often easier to use, when it is necessary
to use some version of the deduction theorem in the
Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE).
Earlier versions of MPE applied the deduction theorem, or a weakened
form of it, in a number of situations.
For more information about using the deduction theorem and the
weak deduction theorem, including more details of why this can be
complicated, see the
<A HREF="mmdeduction.html">deduction theorem page</A>.

<P>
Today, the deduction theorem (including the weak variant of it)
is rarely used in MPE when creating new proofs.
That is because we have found much easier ways to achieve the same result.
The rest of this page explains these easier ways.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="current"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Current approach to deductions</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current MPE conventions
encourage using forms that are easier to deal with directly.

<P>
In particular, there is a preference for
writing assertions in "deduction form"
instead of writing a proof that would require use of the deduction theorem.
Applying this approach is called "deduction style".
An assertion is in deduction form if the conclusion is an implication with
a wff variable as the antecedent
(usually <IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>),
and every hypothesis is either a definition or is also an implication
with the same wff variable as the antecedent
(usually <IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>).
A definition can be for a class variable
(this is a class variable followed by "=") or a wff variable
(this is a wff variable followed by ` <-> `).
In practice, a proof in deduction form will also contain many steps
that are implications where the antedent is either
that wff variable
(normally
<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>)
or is a conjunction
(...<IMG SRC='wedge.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' /\' TITLE='/\'>...)
including that wff variable
(<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>).

<P>
For example,
<A HREF="lhop.html">lhop</A> (L'Hopital's rule) is in deduction form.
Its conclusion and most of its hypotheses are implications with
usually <IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>
as the antecent.
One hypothesis is not an implication;
instead, it is a definition of a class variable, which is
also allowed in deduction form.
(Later, in the section on
<A HREF="#definitions-deduction">Definitions in deduction form</A>,
we'll explain why it definitions are allowed in deduction form.)

<P>
In deduction form the antecedent
(e.g., <IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>)
mimics the context handled in the deduction theorem.
The deduction form antecedent can also be used to represent
the context necessary to support
<A HREF="#natural-deduction-metamath">natural deduction systems</A>.
For example, if the antecedent is a conjunction, the other terms can
represent the temporary assumptions that are sometimes used in
natural deduction.
Before we discuss how to do natural deduction in MPE, we will first
explain what natural deduction is.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="introduction-natural-deduction"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Introduction to Natural Deduction</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<P>
Natural deduction is a widely-taught approach to logic.
Those unfamiliar with natural deduction, or logic more general, may find
<A HREF="mmset.html#Laboreo">[Laboreo]</A>
to be a useful gentle introduction (with many examples).
More detailed information is available from sources such as
<A HREF="mmset.html#Pfenning">[Pfenning]</A> and
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> (especially chapter 2).
What follows here is a very brief summary.

<P>
Natural deduction (ND) systems, as such, were originally introduced in 1934
by two logicians working independently: Ja&sacute;kowski and Gentzen.
ND systems are supposed to reconstruct, in a formally proper way,
traditional ways of mathematical reasoning
(such as conditional proof, indirect proof, and proof by cases).
As reconstructions they were naturally influenced by previous work,
and many specific ND systems and notations have been developed since their
original work.

<P>
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> pages 31-32
suggests that any natural deductive system must satisfy at least these
three criteria:
<OL>
<LI>"There are some means for entering assumptions into a proof and also
for eliminating them. Usually it requires some bookkeeping devices
for indicating the scope of an assumption, and showing that a part of
a proof depending on eliminated assumption is discharged.</LI>
<LI>There are no (or, at least, very limited set of) axioms, because their
role is taken over by the set of primitive rules for introduction and
elimination of logical constants which means that elementary inferences
instead of formulae are taken as primitive.</LI>
<LI>[A genuine] ND system admits a lot of freedom in proof construction and
possibility of applying several proof search strategies, like conditional
proof, proof by cases, proof by reductio ad absurdum etc."</LI>
</OL>

<P>
There are many variations in ND systems.
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> page 32 believes that
two kinds of variations are especially important:
<OL>
<LI>The kind of basic items (data structures) on which inference rules are
defined.  These notes of a proof tree
"may be formulae (F-systems), sequents (S-systems),
sets of formulae (generalized clauses) or other structured data
(e.g. formulae with labels)".
<LI>The overall format of proof representation, which are generally
"trees (tree- or Gentzen-format or T-system...) or sequences
(linear- or Ja&sacute;kowski format or L-system...)."
</OL>
The various Ja&sacute;kowski systems for creating a linear system
of proof are popular.
Many different graphic devices have been added to show groupings; a
"simplified account, where each assumption is entered with the vertical
line which continues until this subproof is in force, is due to Fitch,
whereas [the] popular system of Copi applies bracketing to closed subproofs"
(<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> page 42).

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="natural-deduction-metamath"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Natural Deduction in Metamath</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<P>
MPE is fundamentally a <B>Hilbert-style</B> system.
However, it is possible to develop proofs in MPE using a
natural deduction (ND) approach as originally developed by
Ja&sacute;kowski and Gentzen.

<P>
The most common and recommended approach is to
use deduction form and apply MPE proven assertions
that are equivalent to the ND rules.
See the <A HREF="#natural-deduction-rules">MPE equivalents of typical
natural deduction (ND) rules</A> for the MPE equivalents.
This approach for applying a natural deduction approach within MPE
is described in more detail in the presentation
<A HREF="http://us.metamath.org/ocat/natded.pdf">"Natural Deductions in the
Metamath Proof Language" by Mario Carneiro, 2014</A>.

<P>
In this style
many steps are an implication, whose antecedent mimics the context
(<IMG SRC='cgamma.gif' WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' _G' TITLE='_G'>)
of most ND systems.
To add an assumption, you would typically use
<A HREF="simpr.html">simpr</A> to show that adding the assumption to the
antecedent implies the assumption in the consequence.
Then, every time you want to use an assertion in the hypothesis scope
that starts outside that scope, simply modify the assertion
(typically using <A HREF="adantr.html">adantr</A>)
to add the ND hypothesis assumption to the antecedent.

<P>
This is most easily understood by looking at some examples.
For an annotated example where some traditional ND rules are
directly applied in MPE, see
<A HREF="ex-natded5.2.html">ex-natded5.2</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3.html">ex-natded5.3</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.7.html">ex-natded5.7</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.8.html">ex-natded5.8</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.13.html">ex-natded5.13</A>,
and
<A HREF="ex-natded9.26.html">ex-natded9.26</A>.

<P>
Only using specific natural deduction rules directly can lead to
very long proofs, for exactly the same reason that only using axioms directly
in Hilbert-style proofs can lead to long proofs.
If the goal is short and clear proofs, then it is better to reuse
already-proven proven assertions in deduction form than to start from
scratch each time.
For example, observe that proof
<A HREF="ex-natded5.8.html">ex-natded5.8</A> -
which is a line-for-line translation of directly using only common ND rules -
is much longer than
<A HREF="ex-natded5.8-2.html">ex-natded5.8-2</A>
(which directly reuses other proven statements)
and <A HREF="ex-natded5.2i.html">ex-natded5.2i</A>
(which doesn't worry about context).
Similarly, <A HREF="ex-natded5.3.html">ex-natded5.3</A> is longer than
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3-2.html">ex-natded5.3-2</A> and
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3i.html">ex-natded5.3i</A>.
In practice, the simplest and clearest
approach to creating a proof depends on what is to be proved.

<!-- TODO: Reformat more of the mathematical statements -->

<P>
The text above describes the most common ways to implement
natural deducation approaches in metamath and MPE.
However, there are alternative approaches for using natural deduction
in metamath.

<P>
Alan Sare has worked on an alternative within MPE, called virtual deduction.
Much more information is available at <A HREF="wvd1.html">wvd1</A>,
and an example is at <A HREF="vk15.4jVD.html">vk15.4jVD</A>
(used to generate <A HREF="vk15.4j.html">vk15.4j</A>).
This approach essentially replaces the outermost implication arrow
<IMG SRC='to.gif' WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' -&gt;' TITLE='-&gt;'>
with a different symbol
<IMG SRC='blacktriangleright.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' -&gt;.' TITLE='-&gt;.'>.
Alan Sare believes this change makes it easier to visualize proofs,
while others disagree.
The <A HREF="http://us.metamath.org/other.html#completeusersproof">completeusersproof tool</A>
is available which supports this alternative approach.

<P>
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lin&eacute; has developed a different
metamath-based system to support natural deduction system called <A
HREF="https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20120402081711/http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">natural
deduction</A> [retrieved 21-Dec-2016].
He reports that his system was inspired by a slide show,
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206192038/http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~chris/papers/2002-pisa.pdf">"From Natural Deduction to Sequent Calculus (and back)"</A>.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="definitions-deduction"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Definitions in deduction form</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<P>
At this point it's probably useful to explain in more detail <I>why</I>
definitions do not require an antecedent in deduction form.
The actual purpose of the
<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'> antecedent
is to introduce a hypothesis that may not
always be satisfiable without some assumptions (and the exact nature of
those assumptions is not known inside the theorem, so the generic
"<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>"
is used). If we are dealing with a true abbreviation, just a short way to
write some symbols, then a definition
"D = ..." hypothesis will either be satisfied
by a similar hypothesis, or by theorem <A HREF="eqid.html">eqid</A>,
which will force the substitution of "..." for "D" in the rest of the theorem.
Since in any
case, the hypothesis can be discharged with no assumptions, the
"<IMG SRC='_varphi.gif' WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=19 ALT=' ph' TITLE='ph'>"
is not necessary.

<P>
Sometimes, we wish to discharge these hypotheses with something that isn't
just an abbreviation. For example, if "J e. ( TopOn ` X )", then X is the
base set of the topology J, so X = U. J (toponuni), but since X = U. J is
not always true in this situation, we can't prove it without the hypothesis
"J e. ( TopOn ` X )". What you have to do here, if you want to use a
theorem that has the hypothesis "|- X = U. J" (to prove some statement |-
P(X)), is use eqid anyway, producing a proof of P(U. J), then use ( ph -> X
= U. J ) and equality theorems to get ( ph -&gt; ( P(X) &lt;-&gt;
P(U. J) ) ), then
use the proof of |- P(U. J) to yield |- ( ph -&gt; P(X) ). An example of this
procedure is the derivation of ishaus2 (which has X = U. J given the
context) from ishaus (which assumes X = U. J with no context).

<P>
The above procedure is always possible to do, but it is not always
convenient since many steps may be needed for the equality proof. In cases
where we specifically intend to discharge the assumption with something
other than eqid, we sometimes add ph -&gt; to the equalities as well. A common
example of this is in structure builder theorems, where we want to use a
self-referential expression for the left hand side. For example, we might
define a group by
<PRE>
$e |- ( ph -&gt; B = my-base-set )
$e |- ( ph -&gt; .+ = my-group-op(B) )
mygroupval $p |- ( ph -&gt; MyGroup = { &lt;. ( Base ` ndx ) ,
                   B &gt;. , &lt;. ( +g ` ndx ) , .+ &gt;. } )
</PRE>

<P>
Suppose that my-base-set is a complicated expression, and my-group-op(B)
has a lot of references to B, so the fully expanded
my-group-op(my-base-set) is really big, and we don't want to use it too
many times. In the same context, we then prove:

<PRE>
$e |- ( ph -&gt; B = my-base-set )
$e |- ( ph -&gt; .+ = my-group-op(B) )
mygroupbaslem $p |- ( ph -&gt; ( Base ` MyGroup ) = my-base-set )
mygroupaddlem $p |- ( ph -&gt; ( +g ` MyGroup ) = my-group-op(B) )
</PRE>

<P>
and now we can bootstrap the whole thing:

<PRE>
mygroupbas $p |- ( ph -&gt; ( Base ` MyGroup ) = my-base-set ) $=
1::eqid |- ( ph -&gt; my-base-set = my-base-set )
2::eqid |- ( ph -&gt; my-group-op = my-group-op(my-base-set) )
qed:1,2:mygroupbaslem |- ( ph -&gt; ( Base ` MyGroup ) = my-base-set )

mygroupadd $p |- ( ph -&gt; ( +g ` MyGroup ) = my-base-set ) $=
1::mygroupbas |- ( ph -&gt; ( Base ` MyGroup ) = my-base-set )
2::eqid |- ( ph -&gt; my-group-op( ( Base ` MyGroup ) ) = my-group-op( ( Base
` MyGroup ) ) )
qed:1,2:mygroupbaslem |- ( ph -&gt; ( +g ` MyGroup ) = my-group-op( ( Base `
MyGroup ) ) )
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the contained references of my-group-op are now referencing
( Base ` MyGroup ), which makes this "definition" of a component of MyGroup
self-referential. But that was the goal, and we have mygroupbas to expand
it as necessary. A more elaborate version of this idea is done in prdsval,
with prdsbas, prdsplusg, prdsmulr, etc pulling off components and
bootstrapping using the previous theorems.

<P>
Finally, there are a few places where ( ph -&gt; X = ... ) definitions are
used by convention, specifically grppropd and other *propd theorems, and
isgrpd and other is*d theorems for structures.

<P>
As a rule of thumb: Use X = ... abbreviations unless you need to use a
non-identity abbreviation for X later.
