If you came to this page because you
found a proof referencing the Weak Deduction Theorem <A
HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> (or one of its variants dedth<I>xx</I>),
here is how to follow the proof without getting into the details
described on this page: just
click on the theorem referenced in the step
just before the reference to <A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A>
and ignore everything else.  All that <A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A>
does is turn a
hypothesis into an antecedent (i.e. the hypothesis followed by ` -> ` is placed in
front of the assertion, and the hypothesis itself is eliminated).
<B>Example:</B> Look at the proof of
<A HREF="renegcl.html">renegcl</A>.  In step 5, there is a reference
to the deduction <A HREF="renegcli.html">renegcli</A>,
"` |- A e. RR `&nbsp;&nbsp;` => `&nbsp;&nbsp;
` |- -u A e. RR `".  A special substitution instance of
<A HREF="renegcli.html">renegcli</A>
is used to feed the last hypothesis of
the deduction theorem <A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A>, which in turn
converts it to the theorem
"` |- ( A e. ` ` RR -> -u A e. RR ) `" in step 6.  The somewhat
strange-looking steps before step 5 are just some technical stuff that
makes this magic work, and they can be ignored for a quick
overview of the proof.  To continue following the "important" part of
the proof, click on the reference to <A HREF="renegcli.html">renegcli</A> at
step 5.

<P>
On this page we attempt to show you how this technical stuff works if you are
interested.  We also discuss the <A HREF="#set">conditional operator</A>
"` if ( ph , A , B ) `" that you will find in these proofs.
</P>

<P>
In many situations today MPE no longer uses the approach described here.  We
instead tend to use <A HREF="mmnatded.html">deduction form and natural
deduction</A>.  However, the approach described here is still valid, and it may
be interesting to you.

<p>
Why does Metamath need these complicated-looking steps to convert an inference
(deduction) into a closed theorem, when other systems of logic typically have
a (metalogical) rule that allows to do it in one step?  The answer is that
these steps are part of the price for Metamath's philosophical goal to show
all proofs <I>directly</I> from the axiom system in its database and not have
to rely on higher-level metatheorems derived outside of that axiom system.
From a practical point of view, this minimalist philosophy also makes
automated proof verification extremely simple:  the only metalogical rule
needed to construct a proof from the axioms is the substitution of an
expression for a variable (as well as checking the non-violation of disjoint
variable conditions).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <B>deduction</B> (also called an <B>inference</B>) is a kind of statement
that needs some hypotheses to be true in order for its conclusion to be true.
A <B>theorem</B>, on the other hand, has no hypotheses.  (Informally we may
call both of them theorems, but on this page we will stick to the strict
definition.)  An example of a deduction is the contraposition inference:
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD><A HREF="con3i.html">con3i</A></TD>
<TD>` |- ( ph -> ps ) `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` => `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    ` |- ( -. ps -> -. ph ) `</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
This means that if we have proved a theorem of the form ` |- ( ph -> ps ) `
(where ` ph ` and ` ps ` are any wffs), then we can conclude the theorem
` |- ( -. ps -> -. ph ) ` .  Here, the symbol &quot;` |- `&quot; is just a
place-holder that can be read as &quot;a proof exists for&quot;.  The big arrow
connecting the hypothesis and conclusion isn't a formal mathematical symbol; I
put it there to suggest informally the relationship between hypothesis and
conclusion.  To gain an informal feel for what the contraposition inference
says, suppose we agree with the English statement, &quot;If it is raining,
there are clouds in the sky.&quot;  From contraposition we can conclude,
&quot;If there are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining.&quot;
</P>

<P>
An example of a theorem is the law of contraposition:
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD><A HREF="con3ALT.html">con3ALT</A></TD>
<TD>` |- ( ( ph -> ps ) -> ( -. ps -> -. ph ) ) `</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
This looks almost the same as the deduction, except the hypothesis and
conclusion are connected together with the formal mathematical symbol for
&quot;implies&quot;.  We don't have to prove a hypothesis; instead it is a
standalone statement that is unconditionally true.  Even though it looks
similar, it is &quot;stronger&quot; than the deduction in a fundamental way.

It sometimes happens that we have proved a deduction of the form
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD>` |- si `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` => `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ` |- ta ` </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
and we want to then prove a theorem of the form
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD> ` |- ( si -> ta ) ` </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
Doing this is not as simple as you might think.  The deduction says, "if we can
prove ` si ` then we can prove ` ta ` ,&quot; which is in some sense
weaker<FONT SIZE=-1>*</FONT> than saying &quot;` si ` implies ` ta ` .&quot;
Now, there is no axiom of logic that permits us to directly obtain the theorem
given the deduction.  However, it is possible to make use of information
contained in the deduction or its proof to assist us with the proof of the
theorem, and this is what the standard deduction (meta)theorem and a related
version that we use are all about.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, if we have the theorem, it is easy to recover the deduction
using modus ponens <A HREF="ax-mp.html">ax-mp</A>.  An example of this is the
derivation of the inference <A HREF="simpli.html">simpli</A> from the theorem
<A HREF="simpl.html">simpl</A>.

*For example, the conversion of a deduction to its theorem form does not hold
in general for <A HREF="../qlegif/mmql.html#prop">quantum propositional
calculus</A>, which is a weak subset of classical propositional calculus.  In
fact, it has been shown that adding the Standard Deduction Theorem (below) to
quantum propositional calculus turns it into classical propositional calculus!

<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">The Standard Deduction Theorem</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In traditional logic books, there is a metatheorem called the <B>Standard
Deduction Theorem</B> (discovered independently by Herbrand and Tarski around
1930; I added "Standard" to distinguish it from our "Weak" version below) that
provides an algorithm for constructing a proof of a theorem from the proof of
its corresponding deduction.  See, for example, Margaris, <I>First Order
Mathematical Logic,</I> p. 56.  To construct a proof for a theorem, the
algorithm looks at each step in the proof of the original deduction and
rewrites the step with several steps wherein the hypothesis is eliminated and
becomes an antecedent.
</P>

<P>In ordinary mathematics, no one actually carries out the algorithm,
because (in its most basic form) it involves an exponential explosion of
the number of proof steps as more hypotheses are eliminated.  Instead,
the Standard Deduction Theorem is invoked simply to claim that it can be
done in principle, without actually doing it.

<!--
<P>On these Metamath web pages, we want to show you actual proofs rather
than just telling you that a proof is possible.  It is kind of like the
difference between saying, &quot;according to advanced number theory,
this large integer is composite&quot;, versus &quot;here are the factors
of this large integer.&quot; Only a few people could verify the former,
whereas almost anyone could verify the latter, even though they are both
valid ways of proving that an integer is composite.

The use of a high-level metatheorem such as the Standard Deduction
Theorem in our proofs would require you to learn metamathematical
concepts beyond the simple substitution of expressions for variables, in
order to verify for yourself that they are rigorously correct.
-->

<P><A NAME="bad"></A>Actually, the Standard Deduction Theorem is not
quite as simple as it might first appear.  There is a subtle restriction
that must be taken into account when working with predicate calculus.
If the Axiom of Generalization <A HREF="ax-gen.html">ax-gen</A> was used
in the proof of the original deduction (or anywhere in the potentially
large tree of lemmas building up to it) to quantify over a free variable
contained in one of its hypotheses, then converting that hypothesis to
an antecedent may fail.

The following example shows why.  When ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables,
the following (silly) deduction can be <A HREF="dtrucor.html">proved</A> in set
theory:

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD>` |- x ` ` = ` ` y `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` => `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
` |- x ` ` =/= ` ` y `</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
The reason this deduction holds is that the hypothesis, which effectively
states (using <A HREF="ax-gen.html">ax-gen</A>) "for all ` x ` and ` y ` ,
` x = y ` is true", can never be proved as a standalone theorem.  In fact it
is provably false (by <A HREF="dtru.html">dtru</A>), so any conclusion
whatsoever follows from it.  However, if we naively apply the Standard
Deduction Theorem and blindly convert the hypothesis to an antecedent, the
theorem form of this deduction:
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
("if two things are equal then they are not equal") is obviously
<A HREF="dtrucor2.html">absurd</A>!
</P>

<P>
<I>Note.</I>
The way we have presented the Standard Deduction Theorem above is slightly
different from that in most textbooks, which use a list of hypotheses to the
left of the the turnstile symbol ` |- ` .  This is discussed further in the
<A HREF="#meta">Logic, Metalogic,...</A> section below.
</P>

<P>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="weak"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Weak Deduction Theorem</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of the goals of Metamath is to let you plainly see, with as few underlying
concepts as possible, how mathematics can be derived <I>directly</I> from the
axioms, and not indirectly according to some hidden rules buried inside a
program or understood only by logicians.  If we added the Standard Deduction
Theorem to the language and proof verifier, that would greatly complicate both
and largely defeat Metamath's goal of simplicity.

<!--
In addition, Metamath is intended in principle to be independent of any
particular system of logic, including quantum logic where
the Standard Deduction Theorem fails.  If the Standard Deduction
Theorem were built in as a high-level rule, it would defeat this
purpose. -->

In principle, we could show direct proofs by expanding out the proof
steps generated by the algorithm of the Standard Deduction Theorem, but
it is not feasible in practice because the number of proof steps quickly
becomes huge, even astronomical.  Since the algorithm is driven by proof
of the deduction, we would have to go through that proof all over
again&mdash;starting from axioms&mdash;in order to obtain the theorem
form.  In terms of proof length, there would be no savings over just
proving the theorem directly instead of first proving the deduction
form.

<P>There is a much more efficient method for proving a theorem from a
deduction that can be used in many (but not all) cases.  We call it the
<B>Weak Deduction Theorem</B>.  (There is also an unrelated "Weak
Deduction Theorem" in the field of relevance logic, so to avoid
confusion we could call ours the "Weak Deduction Theorem for Classical
Logic".)  Unlike the Standard Deduction Theorem, the Weak Deduction
Theorem produces the theorem directly from a special substitution
instance of the deduction, using a small, fixed number of steps roughly
proportional to the length of the final theorem.  The number of
additional steps is completely independent of the size of the original
proof, so in practice it can be applied to very advanced theorems
without a corresponding increase in proof size.  There are also no
restrictions on the use of the Axiom of Generalization that may cause us
to stumble:  how the original deduction was proved is irrelevant.

<P>The Weak Deduction Theorem is used frequently in the Metamath Proof
Explorer, especially in set theory, in order to make formal proofs more
compact.  Here we describe it in some detail since it is not necessarily
intuitive, nor has it ever been published.

<P>What are its limitations?  Specifically, we must be able to prove a
special case of the deduction hypothesis as a standalone theorem.
This means it cannot be used in all cases&mdash;for example, it cannot be
used when the hypothesis is a contradiction such as ` ( ph /\ -. ph ) ` .
However, in the case of the contraposition deduction above, by
substituting ` ph ` for ` ps ` in the hypothesis ` |- ( ph `
` -> ps ) ` , we obtain the trivially proved
identity theorem <A HREF="id.html">id</A>,&nbsp; ` |- ( ph -> ph ) ` .  This
special case can be used (together with some auxiliary lemmas) to
eliminate the hypothesis and introduce it as an antecedent.

<P>Does this limitation cause us inconvenience?  In Metamath's set
theory development, a modified version for class variables (see the <A
HREF="#set">set theory version</A> below) is used extensively.  For most
practical deductions we can almost always display an easy-to-prove
special case of a hypothesis, since otherwise the deduction tends not to
be of much use.  For example, if the hypothesis requires a class
variable to be a nonzero real number, the special case of the number 1
will satisfy the hypothesis.

<P>An exception is a deduction for which we can never display an actual
example satisfying its hypothesis but can show only the existence of a
set satisfying it.  Theorems involving the <A HREF="ac5.html">Axiom of
Choice</A> are sometimes like this.  In such a case, the Weak Deduction
Theorem cannot be used.  Therefore we must settle for a longer direct
proof of the theorem form, but so far I haven't encountered a case where
this has been impractical.

<P>Is this to say that the Standard Deduction Theorem is of little use?
Definitely not!  When outlining proofs prior to entering and verifying
them with the Metamath program, I informally use the Standard Deduction
Theorem implicitly and extensively just like any mathematician would.
When satisfied with the informal outline, I then work out the details
necessary to create a (hopefully short) formal proof either directly or
with the help of the Weak Deduction Theorem.

<!--  The nitpicking and
absolutely rigorous formal proofs of Metamath are often quite different
from the informal high-level reasoning that mathematicians use in
practice.  High-level informal reasoning is essential for achieving
practical results in mathematics, but it is also dangerously subject to
the possibility of an error for those who are inexperienced, and the
complete elimination of this possibility is part of what Metamath is
about.  -->

<P>
By the way, the Standard and Weak Deduction Theorems are not
&quot;theorems&quot; in the sense described in the &quot;Deductions vs.
Theorems&quot; section above but are "metatheorems" (or more precisely
&quot;metametatheorems,&quot; since all Metamath theorems are actually theorem
schemes) whose proofs require metamathematics outside of the axiom system.
Specifically, they are both algorithms for generating actual proofs.  However,
once the Weak Deduction Theorem generates a proof, questions about the
justification and rigor of its metamathematics become irrelevant, because the
proof it produces is independently verified by the Metamath proof verifier.
Where a proof came from, whether written by a human or generated by some
algorithm, is of no importance to the verifier.  The same cannot be said about
the Standard Deduction Theorem in the way it is normally used, since it does
not produce a practical proof that can be verified directly but only shows that
a proof is possible in principle.

In logic textbooks, the treatment of the Standard Deduction Theorem is slightly
different from how we presented it above.  They typically show deductions in
the following way: the set of hypotheses is shown to the left of the turnstile
` |- ` , and the conclusion from them to the right.  For example, the deduction
<A HREF="con3i.html">con3i</A> in <A HREF="#dedvsth">Deductions vs.
Theorems</A> would be represented as
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD><A HREF="con3i.html">con3i</A></TD>
<TD>` { ( ph -> ps ) } ` ` |- ( -. ps -> -. ph ) `
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
In order to talk conveniently about deductions in general, the set of
hypotheses may represented by a metavariable such as ` _G ` that ranges over
sets of wffs, with a conclusion represented by a metavariable such as ` ta `
ranging over wffs:
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD>` _G ` ` |- ta ` </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
For example, Theorem 7 in [<A HREF="mmset.html#Margaris">Margaris</A>] p. 76
states (using our notation),
</P>

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#EEFFFA">
<TR ALIGN=LEFT>
<TD>If ` _G |- ta ` , then ` _G ` ` |- A. x ta ` , provided that ` x ` is not
free in ` _G ` .</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</P>

<P>
There are actually three kinds of implications in this statement.  First we
have any implication arrow ` -> ` (not shown) that might be present in the wff
represented by ` ta ` .  At the next higher level, we have the connection
between ` _G ` and ` ta ` that is represented by the turnstile ` |- ` .
Finally at the top-most level, we have the connection between the two
deductions of the theorem, represented by the English phrase "If...then".  We
might think of these three as belonging to the logic, the metalogic, and the
metametalogic respectively.
</P>

<!--
(If we want to have fun with words, in Metamath an implication arrow ` -> ` is
actually part of a <A HREF="mmset.html#schemes">scheme</A> and thus at the
level of metalogic.  So the two higher levels are really metametalogic and
metametametalogic!)
-->

<P>
The expression between the "if" and "then" above is usually called a "premise"
rather then a "hypothesis".  The Standard Deduction Theorem does not provide
for the elimination of premises, only of hypotheses.  Viewed in this way, there
is actually a fundamental difference between the Standard Deduction Theorem and
the Weak Deduction Theorem: the former applies to hypotheses, and the latter
applies to premises.  In other words, they apply to different "meta" levels.
</P>

<P>
The set.mm database doesn't have a way of representing deductions in the way we
have just described.  However, the "natural deduction" database
<A HREF="http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Natural_deduction_based_metamath_system">nat.mm</A>
[external], developed by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lin&eacute;, shows how this can
be done in the Metamath language.  Under such a system, Margaris's theorem
would be represented in the database with a premise ($e statement) for the
expression "` _G |- ta `" and with a provable conclusion ($p statement) for the
expression "` _G |- A. x ta `".
</P>

<!--
<P>Looking at it this way, the Weak Deduction Theorem is actually quite
different in nature from the Standard Deduction Theorem.  It converts a
hypothesis at the metametalogic level to an antecedent at the logic
level, skipping the metalogic level entirely.
-->
  <!-- Indeed, there is an
important intrinsic difference that can be seen immediately:  the
hypotheses for the Weak Deduction Theorem are asserted to be provable
statements (due to their turnstiles), whereas the hypotheses of the
Standard Deduction Theorem do not have to be provable.  -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Suggestion:</I> This section describes the technical details of our
Weak Deduction Theorem and is unfortunately quite complex.  If you want
to understand how it works, you will be less confused if you first
carefully study the <A HREF="#proof">informal proof</A> below.  Then you
may want to take a quick look at the <A HREF="#propex">propositional
calculus example</A> in the next section before continuing with this
section, in order to see a concrete example that achieves our goal.

<P><I>Another suggestion:</I> If you are familiar with a little set
theory, you may want to skip ahead directly to the <A HREF="#set">Weak
Deduction Theorem in set theory</A>, which may be easier to understand.
We never use the Weak Deduction Theorem in propositional calculus except
in the contrived example <A HREF="con3ALT.html">con3ALT</A> created for
the next section.

<P>
The auxiliary lemmas we need for the Weak Deduction Theorem in propositional
calculus are <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> and <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>.
The first takes the special case (such as <A HREF="id.html">id</A> above) as
its third hypothesis and builds a strange-looking theorem from it.  This
strange-looking theorem is a substitution instance of the hypothesis we want to
convert to an antecedent.  We then apply the strange-looking theorem to the
hypothesis of the deduction, resulting in a (still strange-looking)
substitution instance of its conclusion.  Finally, we take this result and
apply it to the second hypothesis of <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, and
magically the desired theorem pops out as the conclusion of
<A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, with the original hypothesis transformed into an
antecedent.  Below we show these auxiliary lemmas.

In lemma <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A>, the wff ` ch ` is the hypothesis of
the original deduction.  The wff ` th ` is the special case (such as
<A HREF="id.html">id</A> in our example above) of that hypothesis.  The wff
variable ` ph ` is the deduction's hypothesis that is replaced with wff
variable ` ps ` to result in the special case.  The first two hypotheses of
<A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> are trivially-proved technical hypotheses that
specify the substitution instances we need.  The first one tells
<A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> that when the wff ` if- ( ch , ph , ps ) ` is
substituted for the wff variable ` ph ` in the wff ` ch ` (the hypothesis of
the original deduction), the result is the wff ` ta ` .  The "substitution" of
` if- ( ch , ph , ps ) ` for ` ps ` (in the wff ` th ` to result in the wff
` ta `) specified by the second hypothesis of <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> is
special &mdash; not all occurrences of the wff variable ` ps ` are replaced,
but only the ones at the variable positions replaced in the first
<A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> hypothesis (Step 6 of the example in the next
section will help clarify this).
</P>

<P>
The conclusion of <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> is applied to the hypothesis
of a matching substitution instance of the original deduction, which in turn
produces as its conclusion a wff that is applied to the second hypothesis of
lemma <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>.
</P>

<P>
In lemma <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, the wff ` ch ` is the hypothesis of the
original deduction, and the wff ` th ` is the conclusion of the original
deduction.  The first hypothesis of <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A> tells it that
when the wff ` if- ( ch , ph , ps ) ` is substituted for the wff variable
` ph ` in the wff ` th ` , the result is the wff ` ta ` .  The conclusion of
<A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, the wff ` ( ch -> th ) ` , is the desired
theorem.

<P>
It may be hard to understand intuitively how the Weak Deduction Theorem works
just by looking at <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A> and
<A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>.  In a later section, we give a
<A HREF="#proof">proof</A> that presents the algorithm in detail and should be
easier to understand.  Our two lemmas just encapsulate the algorithm into a
form convenient to use.

Let's examine the application of these lemmas in the contraposition theorem
<A HREF="con3ALT.html">con3ALT</A> (look at its proof).  Step 7 applies the
special case <A HREF="id.html">id</A> to the third hypothesis of
<A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A>, resulting in step 8.  Step 8 is applied to the
hypothesis of the contraposition deduction <A HREF="con3i.html">con3i</A> to
result in Step 9.  Finally, Step 9 is applied to the second hypothesis of
<A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, resulting in the contraposition theorem.
</P>

<P>
Steps 1 through 6 of <A HREF="con3ALT.html">con3ALT</A> build the technical
substitution instances that we need.  In general these substitution instances
are quite easy to prove by repeatedly applying "formula-builder" lemmas such as
<A HREF="notbid.html">notbid</A> and <A HREF="imbi1d.html">imbi1d</A>.  Note
that we use the term "substitution" in a nonstandard way in the description of
Step 6 below, since not all occurrences of the thing being substituted for are
replaced.
</P>

<P>
Step 3 proves that the substitution of ` if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) ` for
` ps ` in the contraposition conclusion wff ` ( -. ps -> -. ph ) ` results in
` ( -. if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) -> -. ph ) ` .  This is assigned to the
first hypothesis of <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>.
</P>

<P>
Step 4 proves that the substitution of ` if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) ` for
` ps ` in the contraposition hypothesis wff ` ( ph -> ps ) ` results in
` ( ph -> if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) ) ` .  This is assigned to the first
hypothesis of <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A>.
</P>

<P>
Step 6 proves that the substitution of ` if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) ` for
<I>only the second</I> ` ph ` in the special case wff ` ( ph -> ph ) ` results
in ` ( ph -> if- ( ( ph -> ps ) , ps , ph ) ) ` .  Unlike a "normal"
substitution, we replaced only the second one because that was the position
where the substitution took place in Step 4.  This is assigned to the second
hypothesis of <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A>.
</P>

<P>
In practice, the Weak Deduction Theorem is not used very often in our
propositional calculus development because direct proofs that build on a
previously proved hierarchy of theorems are usually more efficient.  In fact,
our proof of the contraposition theorem <A HREF="con3ALT.html">con3ALT</A> was
contrived just for the purpose of this example.  Compare the more efficient
direct proof of the same theorem in <A HREF="con3.html">con3</A>.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="set"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">The Weak Deduction Theorem in Set Theory</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where the Weak Deduction Theorem becomes very useful, if not essential, is in
set theory.  For set theory, special versions of <A HREF="elimh.html">elimh</A>
and <A HREF="dedt.html">dedt</A>, called <A HREF="elimhyp.html">elimhyp</A> and
<A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> respectively, work with substitutions into
classes instead of wffs.
</P>

<P>
To make things more efficient, we introduce a special notation called the
&quot;conditional operator&quot; and denoted by &quot;` if ( ph , A , B ) `
&quot; which combines a wff and two classes to produce another class.
See definition <A HREF="df-if.html">df-if</A>.
Read &quot;` if ( ph , A , B ) `&quot; as &quot;if ` ph ` is true then the
value is ` A ` else the value is ` B ` .&quot;  It is
just an abbreviation for a more complicated class expression like other
such abbreviations (class union, etc.).  This abbreviation makes working
with the Weak Deduction Theorem a little easier, and like all
definitions, in principle it can be eliminated by expanding out the
abbreviation at each occurrence in a proof.  (It also has many other
applications in addition to its use with the Weak Deduction Theorem.)

<P>Next, there are two basic lemmas involving the conditional operator
that we use for the Weak Deduction Theorem.  The
lemma <A HREF="elimhyp.html">elimhyp</A> is intended to take a provable
special case of the hypothesis to be eliminated and transform it into a
special substitution instance of that hypothesis.  This in turn is fed
into the deduction to be eliminated, and the deduction's output is then
fed into the lemma <A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> to produce the final
theorem.

<P>The last hypothesis of each of the following lemmas is the important
one.  The other hypotheses just specify the substitution instances we
need and are are always easily constructed using simple equality laws.
Using each last hypothesis as the "input" to each lemma, the proof of a
theorem from a deduction follows this outline:  [provable special case]
-&gt; <A HREF="elimhyp.html">elimhyp</A> -&gt; [known deduction] -&gt;
<A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> -&gt; [deduction converted to theorem].

<P>
An auxiliary lemma, <A HREF="keephyp.html">keephyp</A>, can be used if we wish
to eliminate some hypotheses but keep others.

In addition to the above lemmas, a number of variations are also proved for
convenient use.  These allow us to eliminate several hypotheses simultaneously,
to eliminate hypotheses where multiple class variables must be substituted
simultaneously with specific classes in order to obtain the provable special
case, and to eliminate hypotheses that occur in frequently-used specific forms.
They can be browsed by clicking on <A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> then clicking
on the "Related theorems" link.  It is easiest to learn how they work by
looking at examples of their use, which can be found in the "This theorem is

In propositional calculus, the deduction theorem for one hypothesis states
(where A and B are wffs):

   If  A |- B  then  |- A -&gt; B

(We will ignore the converse, being a trivial application of modus ponens.  In
the description that follows, all letters refer to fixed wffs or to variables
ranging over wffs&mdash;"wff variables"&mdash;as indicated.)

Here we show a different kind of construction for the deduction theorem that,
unlike the standard Tarski/Herbrand deduction theorem, does not require
rewriting the proof of the deduction but simply adds a fixed number of steps
(roughly proportional to formula length) to a proof for A |- B to result in a
proof for |- A -&gt; B.

It is an unusual application of classical logic in that it involves a kind of
self-reference wherein a formula is substituted into itself.

It is important to note that this version does not replace the standard one
because it is weaker.  In particular, we can't eliminate a hypothesis that is
a contradiction:  for example we can't use the theorem to derive
|- (&not;A ^ A) -&gt; B from &not;A ^ A |- B.  We must be able to prove
separately a special case of the hypothesis.  For example, if we are given
(A -&gt; B) |- (&not;B -&gt; &not;A) and want to prove
|- (A -&gt; B) -&gt; (&not;B -&gt; &not;A), the theorem will give us the proof
provided we also have a proof for the special case |- (B -&gt; B), where wff
"(B -&gt; B)" is the hypothesis "(A -&gt; B)" with B substituted for A.

Now for the theorem.  For our notation, we state axioms, theorems, and proof
steps as _schemes_ where the variables range over wffs.  If F is a wff, and A
is a wff variable contained in F, let us denote F by F(A).  If G is another
wff, then F(G) is the wff obtained by substituting all occurrences of wff
variable A with wff G. (More precisely, we first replace variable A in F with
a new wff variable not occurring elsewhere, then we substitute G for that new
wff variable.  This eliminates any ambiguity when G itself contains A.)  For
example, if F == F(A) = A v B and G = A ^ C, we have F(G) = (A ^ C) v B.
 Also, F(F(A)) = F(F) = (A v B) v B, F(F(F(A))) = ((A v B) v B) v B, etc.  I
 hope this notation is clear.


Theorem
-------

Assume F |- G.  Denote F by F(A) where A is some wff variable in F, and assume
there is a wff B such that |- F(B).  Then, in classical logic, |- F -&gt; G.

Proof
-----

We will use F and F(A) interchangeably, and we also will denote G by G(A).

In classical logic, we have

    |- F -&gt; (A &lt;-&gt; ((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)))             (1)
    |- &not;F -&gt; (B &lt;-&gt; ((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)))            (2)

Also in classical logic, for any wffs P, Q, R, S, T, we have

    If  |- P -&gt; (Q &lt;-&gt; R)  then  |- P -&gt; (&not;Q &lt;-&gt; &not;R)

    If  |- P -&gt; (Q &lt;-&gt; R)  and   |- P -&gt; (S &lt;-&gt; T)
         then  |- P -&gt; ((Q -&gt; S) &lt;-&gt; (R -&gt; T))

corresponding to the primitive connectives &not; and -&gt;.  Using these, and
(1) and (2) as the basis, we derive by induction on the formula length of F
(with ^, v, etc. implicitly expanded into &not; and -&gt; primitives)

    |- F -&gt; (F(A) &lt;-&gt; F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)))         (3)
    |- &not;F -&gt; (F(B) &lt;-&gt; F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)))        (4)

From (3) we have (since F = F(A) by definition)

    |- F -&gt; F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F))                    (5)

Since |- F(B) by hypothesis, from (4) we have

    |- &not;F -&gt; F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F))                   (6)

Combining (5) and (6), we obtain

    |- F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F))                         (7)

By hypothesis F(A) |- G(A).  Substituting ((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)) for A gives

    F((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)) |- G((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F))   (8)

Since (7) satisfies the hypothesis of (8) we have

    |- G((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F))                         (9)

By induction on the formula length of G, from (1) we derive

    |- F -&gt; (G(A) &lt;-&gt; G((A ^ F) v (B ^ &not;F)))         (10)

From (9) and (10) we finally obtain

    |- F -&gt; G            Q.E.D.


Example:  Suppose we have a proof for (A -&gt; B) |- (&not;B -&gt; &not;A) and
also a proof of |- (B -&gt; B), which is a special case of the hypothesis.  Let
F(A) = (A -&gt; B) and G(A) = (&not;B -&gt; &not;A).  Then F(B) = (B -&gt; B),
and the theorem gives us |- (A -&gt; B) -&gt; (&not;B -&gt; &not;A).

The theorem provides us with the algorithm for constructing the proof in
detail if we wish.  For example the proof step corresponding to (7) becomes
|- (A ^ (A -&gt; B)) v (B ^ &not;(A -&gt; B))) -&gt; B.  It is easy to see
that the number of steps in the final proof is equal to the number of steps in
the proof of the original deduction and the special case, plus (primarily) a
number of steps proportional to formula length used to derive (3), (4),
and (10).

The theorem can be extended to eliminate multiple hypotheses, as well as
variants that keep some hypotheses while eliminating others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we mentioned above, the Weak Deduction Theorem cannot always be used to
convert a hypothesis to an antecedent (which is why we call it "weak").
Sometimes, other techniques can be devised for special cases where the Weak
Deduction Theorem cannot be used or is less efficient.  An example is the
theorem <A HREF="dedhb.html">dedhb</A>, which can convert a nonfreeness
hypothesis (an nf* theorem such as <A HREF="nfneg.html">nfneg</A>) to
a closed theorem form, as explained in its description.  In practice, we
usually use the closely related <A HREF="abidnf.html">abidnf</A> to strengthen
an nf* inference to a deduction form such as <A HREF="nfnegd.html">nfnegd</A>.
</P>

<P>
There are very few alternatives to the Standard Deduction Theorem in the
literature.  Historically, it is possible that once the Standard Deduction
Theorem was discovered, mathematicians lost interest in alternate techniques,
since they were no longer considered important.  A mathematician can show, in
one high-level application of the Standard Deduction Theorem, that a proof
exists without displaying the actual proof.  The Metamath proof verifier does
not have that luxury (with the Hilbert-style axiom system of the set.mm
database) unless we were to greatly complicate its language and proof
verification engine.  That would be contrary to the philosophical aim of
Metamath, so efficient actual proofs are important to us.  But techniques such
as those in <I>Principia Mathematica</I> (published before the discovery of the
Standard Deduction Theorem) have become a kind of lost art.
