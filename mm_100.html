<p><a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/%7Efreek/100/">"Formalizing 100
Theorems" by Freek Wiedijk</a> lists 100 mathematical theorems and the
various systems that have formalized a nontrivial number of them.  This
list is discussed in <a
href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101408p.pdf">"Formal Proof
- Getting Started" (Freek Wiedijk, Notices of the AMS, Volume 55, Number
11, December 2008)</a>.  Rightly or wrongly, this list is used by others
to judge proof systems.  Wiedijk's "getting started" picks as its
primary examples HOL Light and Mizar, which at the time had the largest
number of proofs.  Similarly, <a
href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/beeson/Masters/KamThesis.pdf">"Case
Studies in Proof Checking" by Robert C. Kam</a> says, "Judging by Dr.
Wiedijk's Formalizing 100 Theorems list, which gives an overview of the
headway various proof systems have made in mathematics, Coq and Mizar
are two of the most successful systems in use today (Wiedijk,
2007)".</p>

<p>Currently there are <b>74</b> proofs proven by Metamath from this list of
100.  As of 2020-04-05 this number of proofs is more than
Coq (70), Mizar (69),
ProofPower (43), Lean (29),
PVS (22), nqthm/ACL2 (18), and NuPRL/MetaPRL (8);
it is short of only Isabelle (83) and HOL Light (86).
This is very good, especially considering that there had been no significant
effort until 2014 to prove theorems from this list of 100 using Metamath.
In this page, you can see the
<a href="#done">completed Metamath proofs</a> and the
<a href="#todo">Metamath proofs to be done</a> from this list of
metamath proofs.
</p>

<p>Like all Metamath proofs, all reasoning is done directly in the
proof itself rather than by algorithms embedded in the verification
program.  As a result, the proofs are completely transparent with
nothing hidden from the user, and every step can be followed through a
hyperlink to its corresponding proof or definition.
Therefore, the Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE aka set.mm) database
is the <i>largest</i> database of formally-verified mathematics
that records every step of a proof by directly
referring to only an axiom or previous proof
(many competing databases only record tactics that are
intended to rediscover the proof, instead of recording
the specific proven steps actually used in the proof).
</p>

<p>
The theorems in MPE are routinely verified by 5 different programs
written in 5 different programming languages by more than 5 different people.
These are the
original metamath (a C verifier by Norm Megill),
mmj2 (a Java verifier by Mel O'Cat and Mario Carneiro),
smetamath-rs (a high-speed Rust verifier by Stefan O'Rear),
checkmm (a C++ verifier by Eric Schmidt), and
mmverify (a Python verifier by Raph Levien).
This checking by multiple independent verifiers in different languages
provides very strong justification for believing
that the proofs are correct.
</p>

<p>
What's more, all of
the proofs listed here are current and verified with the current
versions of Metamath tools.
This is not the case with some
other systems, where older proofs have not always been kept synchronized
with the current system and thus have become essentially lost.
</p>

<!--
This is different from some other systems.
For example, Isabelle's proof of the prime number theorem was done in
Isabelle2005, and it was not kept up in the Isabelle AFP (its archive of
formal proofs), so its proof is uncheckable with current tools and
essentially lost.
-->

<p>
Since the kernel of Metamath is extremely small and rarely changes, the
underlying Metamath language (as implemented by over a dozen
independently-written verifiers) is very stable over time
and can be verified very rapidly.
The entire
content of  <A HREF="index.html#mmprog">set.mm</A>
set theory database can be verified in less than 5 sec
with the <A HREF="index.html#mmprog">metamath program</A> and in 0.7 sec
with a recent version of Stefan O'Rear's <A
HREF="other.html#smm">smm3</A> verifier that utilizes multiple CPU
cores.  As of June 2016, altogether
the theorems listed here ultimately make use of
12151 of the 28366 theorems in set.mm for their full derivation from ZFC
axioms.  (This doesn't mean that 12151 theorems are dedicated to the
theorems on this list.  Most are library-type theorems shared
by many other theorems; for
example, many of the theorems on this list
depend on the complex number construction, which itself
involves 3014 theorems to derive starting from the ZFC axioms.)</p>

<p id="done">Here is the list of the <a
href="http://www.metamath.org/">Metamath</a> proofs that are available
from this list of 100, along with credit to the individual(s) who
created the Metamath formalization.
Almost all of these proofs are from the <a
href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html">Metamath Proof Explorer</a>,
aka database set.mm, which is based on classical logic.
However, there are some proofs available in the <a
href="http://us.metamath.org/ileuni/mmil.html">Intuitionistic Logic Explorer</a>,
aka database iset.mm, which uses intuitionistic logic instead.
Please let us know about missing entries via

<p><a name="developers"></a><font size=-1>Note for potential
contributors:  The development tools most people use, in addition to a
good text editor, are <a href="index.html#mmj2">mmj2</a> (which has an
introductory video) and the <a href="index.html#mmprog">metamath
program</A> (which has a tutorial in Chapter 2 of the <A
HREF="index.html#book"><i>Metamath</i></a> book).  Most contributors
keep their work in progress in private sections of set.mm called
"mathboxes" to prevent interfering with others' work.  Mathboxes can be
released via a <a
href="https://github.com/metamath/set.mm/tree/develop">GitHub</a> pull
request and will later be moved to the main part of set.mm by its
maintainers as appropriate.  Alternately, mathboxes can be emailed to
Norm.  Requests for help on the <a

can help things go smoother.  See the <a
