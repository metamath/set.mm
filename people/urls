# This file lists the avatars (download images) for people, in the form
# URL space person-name.file-type
# We *only* use images that are already
# publicly-available and associated with that person.
# Most of these avatars are GitHub avatars, as those are already public;
# please record the original account URL in a comment so people don't
# have to work out the username mapping.
# If the avatar is not available for download, but has otherwise been approved,
# please document that in this file as a comment.

# For Norman Megill we use the image used on the 2019 Metamath book cover.
