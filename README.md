# Metamath set.mm repository

This is a collection of databases that specify mathematical axioms and
rigorous formal proofs of various mathematical theorems
derived from those axioms.
This collection is specified and derived using the Metamath system.
A "database" in Metamath parlance is a collection of one or more text files.

This collection is being actively improved by an international community.
Please join us!

The two largest databases in this collection are "set.mm" and "iset.mm".
The "set.mm" database is one of the largest
collections of formally-verified mathematics in the world (e.g., it
has completed many challenge theorems in the
[Formalizing-100 Theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) challenge list).
It is also one of the most rigorously verified collection of
formally-verified mathematics in the world; it's verified by
5 different verifiers written by 5 different people
in 5 different programming languages.

## What is Metamath?

Metamath is a computer language and associated computer program for
archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs.

Unlike some other systems, Metamath does not build a particular set
of axioms into the system. Instead, the Matamath language is simple and robust,
with an almost total absence of hard-wired syntax.
In Metamath you express the axioms *and* the theorems in a database.
To prove a theorem, every proof step *must* be proven using an axiom or
a previously proven theorem; as a result, nothing is hidden.
We believe Metamath provides about the simplest possible framework that
allows essentially all of mathematics to be expressed with absolute rigor.

For more information see
the [Metamath Home Page](http://us.metamath.org/), the
[Metamath Proof Explorer Home Page](http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html),

[video "Metamath Proof Explorer: A Modern Principia Mathematica"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WH4Rd4UKGE).

## What databases are included in this collection?

This is a collection of many databases, but since "set.mm" is by far
the most actively maintained, you may want to look at it first even if you
plan to eventually work on something else.
[The video "Metamath Proof Explorer (set.mm) contributions visualized with Gource through 2020-04-29"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGSeDjWzUo) shows set.mm's growth over time.

The databases included, in (approximate) decreasing size, are:

* "set.mm" aka "Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE)" -
  uses classical logic and
  Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).
* "iset.mm" aka "Intuitionistic Logic Explorer" -
  uses intuitionistic set theory.
  In particular, it does not presume that the law of excluded middle is
  necessarily true in all cases.
* "nf.mm" aka "New Foundations Explorer" - constructs mathematics using
  Quine's "New Foundations" (NF) set theory axioms, a direct derivative
  of the "hierarchy of types" set theory originally presented in
  Whitehead and Russell's *Principia Mathematica*.
* "ql.mm" aka "Quantum Logic Explorer" - Starts from the orthomodular
  lattice properties proved in the Hilbert Space Explorer and takes
  you into quantum logic.
* "hol.mm" aka "Higher-Order Logic Explorer" - Starts with HOL (also
  called simple type theory) and derives equivalents to ZFC axioms,
  connecting the two approaches.
* "peano.mm" - Peano arithmetic.
* "big-unifier.mm" - a unification and substitution test for
  Metamath verifiers, where small input expressions blow up to thousands
  of symbols. It is a translation of William McCune's "big-unifier.in"
  for the OTTER theorem prover.
* "miu.mm"  - a simple formal system for use as a demonstration based
  on work by Hofstadter.
* "demo0.mm" - a simple formal system used as a demonstration in
  Chapter 2 of the Metamath book.

## How are they verified?

Changes ("commits") to any database are first automatically verified
before they are accepted, using GitHub actions.

The set.mm and iset.mm databases are the ones primarily being updated.
In *every* change, *each* of these two databases is re-verified by *all*
of the following verifiers:

* metamath.exe aka Cmetamath (the original C verifier by Norman Megill)
* checkmm (a C++ verifier by Eric Schmidt)
* smetamath-rs (smm3) (a Rust verifier by Stefan O'Rear)
* mmj2 (a Java verifier by Mel L. O'Cat and Mario Carneiro)
* mmverify.py (a Python verifier by Raph Levien)

Note that these are different verifiers written in different programming
languages by different people. In addition, the verification algorithm
is intentionally simple (it fits in two pages in the Matamath book),
so it's relatively easy to implement a verifier, it's more likely to be
correct (because of its simplicity), and it's also relatively
easy to review a verifier.
Most math proofs are not formally verified at all (that is, where a
computer verifies every step). The rest are typically only
verified by a single program (which might have an error in it).
Metamath is different.
Our use of multiple independent automated verifiers
provides *extremely* high confidence that these proofs are completely correct.

All other databases are verified by at least one verifier.

## How can I contribute? How are contributions evaluated?

We're a friendly community, and we would love to have more collaborators!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on
how to create a contribution, as well as how contributions are evaluated
to decide if they will be merged in.

## Credits and a memorium

Our sincere thanks to *everyone* who has contributed to this work.

In addition, this entire collection is dedicated to the memory of
[Norman "Norm" Dwight Megill, Ph.D. (1950-2021)](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/norman-megill-obituary?id=31842140),
creator of the Metamath system and cultivator of an international
community of people with the shared dream of digitizing and
formally verifying mathematics.
His ideas and design have been influential in formal mathematics
around the world. He is missed.
