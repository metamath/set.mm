# Metamath set.mm repository

This is a collection of rigorously verified [Metamath](http://us.metamath.org/)
databases that specify mathematical axioms and
formal proofs of theorems derived from those axioms.

## What is Metamath?

Metamath is a computer language and associated computer program for
archiving, verifying, and studying mathematical proofs.

Unlike some other systems, Metamath does not build a particular set
of axioms into the system. Instead, the Metamath language is simple and robust,
with an almost total absence of hard-wired syntax.
In Metamath you express the axioms, theorems, and their proofs in a database
(set of text files).
To prove a theorem, every proof step *must* be proven using an axiom or
a previously proven theorem; as a result, nothing is hidden.
We believe Metamath provides about the simplest possible framework that
allows essentially all of mathematics to be expressed with absolute rigor.

The resulting databases provide human-readable axioms and theorem statements.
We compress proofs in this repository, so their proofs take relatively
little space, but tools can easily decompress them to provide a human-readable
sequence of every proof step.
Metamath verification is incredibly fast; the largest database available
can be re-verified within seconds by some verifiers.

[Metamath Proof Explorer Home Page](http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html),

## What databases are included in this collection?

The databases included and links to their generated displays,
in (approximate) decreasing size, are:

* "[set.mm](./set.mm)" aka "Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE)" -
  uses classical logic and
  Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).
  This is one of the largest collections of formally verified mathematics
  in the world (e.g., it has completed many challenge theorems in the
  [Formalizing-100 Theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) challenge list);
  [this video visualizes set.mm's growth through 2020-04-29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVGSeDjWzUo).
  [[Generated display](http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmset.html)]
* "[iset.mm](./iset.mm)" aka "Intuitionistic Logic Explorer" -
  uses intuitionistic set theory.
  In particular, it does not presume that the law of excluded middle is
  necessarily true in all cases.
  [[Generated display](http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmil.html)]
* "[nf.mm](.nf.mm)" aka "New Foundations Explorer" -
  constructs mathematics using
  Quine's New Foundations (NF) set theory axioms, a direct derivative
  of the "hierarchy of types" set theory originally presented in
  Whitehead and Russell's *Principia Mathematica*.
  [[Generated display](http://us.metamath.org/nfeuni/mmnf.html)]
* "[ql.mm](./ql.mm)" aka "Quantum Logic Explorer" - Starts from the
  orthomodular lattice properties proved in the Hilbert Space Explorer and
  takes you into quantum logic.
  [[Generated display](http://us.metamath.org/qleuni/mmql.html)]
* "[hol.mm](./hol.mm)" aka "Higher-Order Logic Explorer" - Starts with
  higher-order logic (HOL, also called simple type theory) and derives
  equivalents to ZFC axioms, connecting the two approaches.
  [[Generated display](http://us.metamath.org/holuni/mmhol.html)]
* "[peano.mm](./peano.mm)" - Peano arithmetic.
* "[big-unifier.mm](./big-unifier.mm)" - a unification and substitution test for
  Metamath verifiers, where small input expressions blow up to thousands
  of symbols. It is a translation of William McCune's "big-unifier.in"
  for the OTTER theorem prover.
* "[miu.mm](./miu.mm)"  - a simple formal system for use as a
  demonstration based on work by Hofstadter.
* "[demo0.mm](./demo0.mm)" - a simple formal system used as a demonstration in
  Chapter 2 of the Metamath book.

## How are the databases verified?

We work to provide *extremely* high confidence that the
proofs are completely correct in these databases,
especially for the set.mm and iset.mm databases (the
primary databases under active development).

Changes ("commits") to any database are first automatically verified
before they are accepted, using GitHub actions. Every change to
set.mm and iset.mm is verified by many independent verifiers,
including metamath-exe, which also checks markup, and mmj2, which
checks definition soundness. All other databases' proofs are verified
by one verifier (metamath-exe) in every commit.
For more information, see [VERIFIERS.md](./VERIFIERS.md).

## How can I contribute? How are contributions evaluated?

We're a friendly community, and we would love to have more collaborators!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on
how to create a contribution, as well as how contributions are evaluated
to decide if they will be merged in.

## Credits and a memorium

Our sincere thanks to *everyone* who has contributed to this work.

This entire collection is dedicated to the memory of
[Norman "Norm" Dwight Megill, Ph.D. (1950-2021)](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/norman-megill-obituary?id=31842140),
creator of the Metamath system and cultivator of an international
community of people with the shared dream of digitizing and
formally verifying mathematics.
His ideas and design have been influential in formal mathematics
around the world. He is missed.
