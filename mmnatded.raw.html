&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A <B>deduction</B> (also called an <B>inference</B>) is a kind of
statement that needs some hypotheses to be true in order for its
conclusion to be true.  A <B>theorem</B>, on the other hand, has no
hypotheses (or all its hypotheses are definitions).
Informally we often call both of them theorems, but on this
page we will stick to the strict definition.

<P>
When being rigorous,
it is surprisingly complicated to convert some deduction in the form
` |- si `
` => `
` |- ta `
into some theorem in the form
` |- ( si -> ta ) ` .
The deduction says,
"if we can prove
` si `
 then we can prove
` ta ` ,&quot;
which is in some
sense weaker than saying
&quot; ` si `
implies
` ta ` .&quot;
In particular, there is no axiom of logic that
permits us to directly obtain the theorem given the deduction.
The conversion of a deduction to a theorem does not even hold in general
for <A HREF="../qlegif/mmql.html#prop">quantum propositional calculus</A>,
which is a weak subset of classical propositional calculus.
It has been shown that adding the Standard Deduction Theorem
to quantum propositional calculus turns it into classical
propositional calculus!

<P>
This is in contrast to going the other way;
if we have the theorem, it is easy to recover the
deduction using modus ponens <A HREF="ax-mp.html">ax-mp</A>.
An example of this is the derivation of the inference
<A HREF="simpli.html">simpli</A> from the theorem <A
HREF="simpl.html">simpl</A>.
<A HREF="#conversion">More details about conversions are covered below</A>.

<P>
In traditional logic books, this is often resolved using a metatheorem
called the <B>Deduction Theorem</B> (discovered independently
by Herbrand and Tarski around 1930).
The deduction theorem, aka the standard deduction theorem,
provides an algorithm for constructing a proof of
a theorem from the proof of its corresponding deduction.
See, for example, Margaris, <I>First Order Mathematical Logic,</I> p. 56.
To construct a proof for a theorem, the deduction theorem's algorithm
looks at each step in the proof of the original deduction and rewrites
the step with several steps wherein the hypothesis is eliminated and
becomes an antecedent.
Ordinary mathematical proofs invoke this algorithm when converting
a deduction into a theorem.

<P>
However, in practice, no one actually carries out this conversion
algorithm in ordinary mathematics.
Instead, mathematicians often stop once they believe the conversion
algorithm could be done.
This sharply contrasts with Metamath's philosophical goal, which is
to show all proofs <I>directly</I> from
the axiom system in its database, and not skip steps or
rely on higher-level metatheorems derived outside of that axiom system.

<P>Metamath is capable of converting a hypothesis into an antecedent.
We have found that in many cases only a weakened form
of the deduction theorem is necessary,
called the <B>weak deduction theorem</B>
(<A HREF="dedth.html">dedth</A> and its variants).
The weak deduction theorem is often easier to use when it is necessary
to use some version of the deduction theorem in the
Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE).
Earlier versions of MPE applied the deduction theorem, or a weakened
form of it, in a number of situations.
For more information about using the deduction theorem and the
weak deduction theorem, including more details of why this can be
complicated, see the
<A HREF="mmdeduction.html">deduction theorem page</A>.

<P>
Today, the deduction theorem (including the weak variant of it)
is rarely used in MPE when creating new proofs.
That is because we have found much easier ways to achieve the same result.
The rest of this page explains these easier ways.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="current"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Current approach to deductions</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current MPE conventions
encourage using forms that are easier to deal with directly.

<P>
In general there is a preference today for
writing assertions in "deduction form"
instead of writing a proof that would require use of the deduction theorem.
Applying this approach is called "deduction style".
The power of deduction form in Metamath
was originally identified by Mario Carneiro.

<P>
An assertion is in deduction form if the conclusion is an implication with
a wff variable as the antecedent
(usually ` ph `),
and every MPE hypothesis ($e statement)
is either a definition or is also an implication
with the same wff variable as the antecedent
(usually ` ph `).
A definition can be for a class variable
(this is a class variable followed by "=") or a wff variable
(this is a wff variable followed by
` <-> `); in practice
definitions (if used) are for class variables.
In practice, a proof in deduction form will also contain many steps
that are implications where the antecedent is either that wff variable
(normally
` ph `)
or is a conjunction
(...` /\ ` ...)
including that wff variable
(` ph `).

<P>
For example,
<A HREF="lhop.html">lhop</A> (L'Hopital's rule) is in deduction form,
because
its conclusion and most of its MPE hypotheses are implications with
` ph `
as the antecent.
It has one MPE hypothesis that is not an implication,
but that hypothesis is a definition of a class variable -
which is also allowed in deduction form.
Later, in the section on
<A HREF="#definitions-deduction">Definitions in deduction form</A>,
we'll explain why definitions are allowed in deduction form.

<P>
In deduction form the antecedent
(e.g., ` ph `)
mimics the context handled in the deduction theorem.

<P>
Sometimes we have assertions in multiple forms; here are the forms and the
<A HREF="conventions.html">conventions for their labels (names)</a> when
multiple forms are present:

<UL>
<LI>Deduction form: As already noted,
an assertion is in "deduction form" whenever the
conclusion and all hypotheses are each prefixed with an implication using
the same antecedent (` ph `).
An assertion in deduction form has a label suffix "d" if there
are other forms of the same assertion.
<LI>Inference form: An assertion with hypotheses but no common
antecedent is an "inference form"; it has a label suffix "i".
<LI>Closed form: An assertion is in "closed form" has no hypotheses at all;
all of its preconditions (if any) are part of its implication's antecedent,
and the assertion label (name) has no suffix.
</UL>

<P>
You can compare these forms by comparing
<A HREF="pm2.43.html">pm2.43</A> (closed form),
<A HREF="pm2.43i.html">pm2.43i</A> (inference form), and
<A HREF="pm2.43d.html">pm2.43d</A> (deduction form).

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="conversion"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Conversion</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once you have an assertion in deduction form, you can easily convert it
to inference form or closed form:
<UL>
<LI>To prove some assertion Ti in inference form,
given assertion Td in deduction form, there is a simple mechanical
process you can use.
First take each Ti hypothesis and insert a <tt>T. -&gt;</tt>
prefix ("true implies") using <A HREF="a1i.html">a1i</a>.
You can then use the existing assertion Td to prove the resulting conclusion
with a <tt>T. -&gt;</tt> prefix.
Finally, you can remove that prefix using
<A HREF="mptru.html">mptru</A>, resulting in the conclusion you
wanted to prove.</LI>

<LI>To prove some assertion T in closed form,
given assertion Td in deduction form, there is another simple mechanical
process you can use.
First, select an expression that is the conjunction
(...` /\ ` ...)
of all of the consequents of every hypothesis of Td.
Next, prove that this expression implies each of the separate hypotheses
of Td in turn by eliminating conjuncts
(there are a variety of proven assertions to do this, including
<A HREF="simpl.html">simpl</A>,
<A HREF="simpr.html">simpr</A>,
<A HREF="3simpa.html">3simpa</A>,
<A HREF="3simpb.html">3simpb</A>,
<A HREF="3simpc.html">3simpc</A>,
<A HREF="simp1.html">simp1</A>,
<A HREF="simp2.html">simp2</A>, and
<A HREF="simp3.html">simp3</A>).
If the expression has nested conjunctions,
inner conjuncts can be broken out by chaining the above theorems
with <A HREF="syl.html">syl</A>.
(There are actually many theorems (labeled simp* such as
<A HREF="simp333.html">simp333</A>)
that break out inner conjuncts in one step,
but rather than learning them you can just use the chaining
we just described to prove them, and then let the
metamath.exe command "minimize_with" figure out
the right ones needed to collapse them.)
As your final step, you can then apply the already-proven
assertion Td (which is in deduction form), proving
assertion T in closed form.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As noted earlier, we can also easily convert
any assertion T in closed form to its related assertion Ti in inference form
by applying <A HREF="ax-mp.html">ax-mp</A>.
The challenge, when working formally, can sometimes occur when converting
some arbitrary assertion T in inference form into a related assertion
Td in deduction form.

<P>
An assertion in deduction form that has a hypothesis
can be easily converted so that the hypothesis becomes an implication.
More formally, given an assertion THM in deduction form with
hypothesis $e ` ( ph -> ps ) ` and a conclusion ` ( ph -> ch ) `
we can easily turn THM into the assertion ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` .
Another way to say this is that we can easily convert the THM
` |- ( ph -> ps ) => |- ( ph -> ch ) ` into
` |- ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` , where ` ps ` and ` ch ` are any proposition.
Here the process to do that:

<OL>
<LI>Use ~ simpr to trivially prove that ` |- ( ( ph /\ ps ) -> ps ) ` .
<LI>Use THM and the previous step to prove ` |- ( ( ph /\ ps ) -> ch ) ` .
Note that in this use, ` ( ph /\ ps ) ` is substituting for ` ph ` of
the THM's hypothesis, enabling us to deduce this result from the first step.
<LI>Use ~ ex and the previous step to prove ` ( ph -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` .
</OL>

<P>
Note that converting an assertion in deduction form into an implication
in deduction form is <I>different</I> from the general case of
converting an inference form into an implication.
In the general case that would require the deduction theorem or some variant
like the weak deduction theorem.

<P>
The deduction form antecedent can also be used to represent
the context necessary to support
<A HREF="#natural-deduction-metamath">natural deduction systems</A>.
For example, if the antecedent is a conjunction, the other terms can
represent the temporary assumptions that are sometimes used in
natural deduction.
Below we provide an
<A HREF="#introduction-natural-deduction">introduction to
natural deduction</A>, and then discussion how
<A HREF="#natural-deduction-metamath">natural deduction is implemented
in Metamath set.mm (and iset.mm)</A>.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="special-cases"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Special cases</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are some types of hypotheses where we usually do not use
a ` ph -> ` antecedent in a theorem's deduction form.
Although this may weaken the theorem slightly, omitting this
antecedent where it is not normally needed can make proofs using the theorem
slightly shorter by not having to apply ~ a1i in order to match its
hypotheses.
Here they are, along with a discussion of possible methods to strengthen the
deduction form with ` ph -> ` on one of these hypotheses if needed.

<OL>
<LI>Existence (sethood) hypothesis, e.g., a $e of the form ` |- A e. _V ` .
To add ` ph -> ` if desired,
first turn the ` A e. _V ` into an antecedent using ~ vtoclg
and friends as in e.g. ~ unisng , then convert from this (semi-)closed form
back to deduction form.

<LI>Not-free-in hypothesis, e.g., a $e of the form
` |- F/ x ps ` or ` |- F/_ x A ` .
It is very rare that you really need something of the form
` ph -> F/ x ps ` instead in set.mm, because of the
` A e. V ` , ` B e. V `
assumptions that are needed in order to substitute a variable for a class.
(You can substitute a wff for a variable, if the universe has at least two
elements; for example you can use ` (/) e. x ` as a substitute for
variable ` ph ` ,
where we take ` x ` to be the set ` { y e. 1o | ph } ` .)
The special case where ` ps ` is ` ph ` is given by ~ nf5di .
<BR>
It is possible to prove the not-free theorem for a term constructor given
the equality theorem, provided you can substitute the terms for variables.
Mario demonstrates this in
<A HREF="https://github.com/digama0/mm0/blob/master/examples/peano.mm1#L1019-L1024"
>nfnlem of peano.mm1</A>, as follows.
Suppose we have a constructor "foo ` ( A , B )`" and we want to prove
` ( A e. V /\ B e. V /\ F/_ x A /\ F/_ x B ) -> F/_ x ` foo ` ( A , B ) ` .
We can let ` y = A ` and ` z = B ` be new dummies, then
` F/_ x ` foo ` ( A , B ) <-> F/_ x ` foo ` ( y , z ) ` , but
the latter is true by ~ nfv .
The ` F/_ x A ` and ` F/_ B ` theorems come up when we want to prove
` ( y = A /\ z = B ) -> ( F/_ x ` foo ` ( y , z ) <-> F/_ x ` foo ` ( A , B ) ) ` ;
the nf equality step here requires that the context be free from
` x ` , so you need a special version of the theorem so that this can be given
as a hypothesis.
In the worst case, the
theorem may have to be reproved back through a number of previous
theorems. We do have many "nf*d" theorems that will assist this.
In practice this is practically never needed.

<LI>Definitional hypothesis, e.g., a $e of the form
` |- ( ps <-> ( ch /\ th ) ) ` or ` |- A = ( B + C ) ` .
To prepend ` ph -> ` , eliminate the original hypothesis with ~ biid or ~ eqid ,
then rewrite the proof where the steps are simplified with the new ` ph -> `
prefix form of the definitional hypotheses. See
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/metamath/V6QPBWzqvu4/jmY9kwLWCgAJ"
>Mario's discussion about this</A>.

<LI>Implicit substitution hypothesis, e.g., a $e of the form
` |- ( x = y -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) ` or ` |- ( x = y -> A = B ) ` .
To prepend ` ph -> ` ,
convert the theorem to explicit substitution form, then convert
back to implicit substitution form.
This can be somewhat tedious, but at
least it can be done in principle. See ~ fsumshftd for an example,
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/metamath/vt6SqLrxEfo/tmogkcRPEgAJ"
>as discussed in the mailing list</A>.
<BR>
This conversion is considerably less tedious if ` A ` and ` B `
are closed terms already, i.e., you are applying the theorem in some context
rather than just trying to prove ~ fsumshftd itself
(which doesn't know what ` A ` and ` B ` are).
For instance, if you want to prove
` |- sum_ x e. ( 1 ... 3 ) ( ( x + 1 ) ^ 2 ) = sum_ y e. ( 2 ... 4 ) ( y ^ 2 ) `
by shifting the left sum to the right, you first apply ~ fsumshft without any
funny business in the substitution to prove
` |- sum_ x e. ( 1 ... 3 ) ( ( x + 1 ) ^ 2 ) = sum_ y e. ( 2 ... 4 ) ( ( ( y - 1 ) + 1 ) ^ 2 ) ` ,
then use ~ sumeq2dv and equality theorems to prove
` ( ( ( y - 1 ) + 1 ) ^ 2 ) = ( y ^ 2 ) ` in the current context.
</OL>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, the ` ph -> ` prefix can be used to support
natural deduction.
To understand that, let's first briefly examine natural deduction.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="introduction-natural-deduction"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Introduction to Natural Deduction</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Natural deduction is a widely-taught approach to logic.
Those unfamiliar with natural deduction, or logic more generally, may find
<A HREF="mmset.html#Laboreo">[Laboreo]</A>
to be a useful gentle introduction (with many examples).
More detailed information is available from sources such as
<A HREF="mmset.html#Pfenning">[Pfenning]</A> and
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> (especially chapter 2).
What follows here is a very brief summary.

<P>
Natural deduction (ND) systems, as such, were originally introduced in 1934
by two logicians working independently: Ja&#347;kowski and Gentzen.
ND systems are supposed to reconstruct, in a formally proper way,
traditional ways of mathematical reasoning
(such as conditional proof, indirect proof, and proof by cases).
As reconstructions they were naturally influenced by previous work,
and many specific ND systems and notations have been developed since their
original work.

<P>
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> pages 31-32
suggests that any natural deductive system must satisfy at least these
three criteria:
<OL>
<LI>"There are some means for entering assumptions into a proof and also
for eliminating them. Usually it requires some bookkeeping devices
for indicating the scope of an assumption, and showing that a part of
a proof depending on eliminated assumption is discharged.</LI>
<LI>There are no (or, at least, very limited set of) axioms, because their
role is taken over by the set of primitive rules for introduction and
elimination of logical constants which means that elementary inferences
instead of formulae are taken as primitive.</LI>
<LI>[A genuine] ND system admits a lot of freedom in proof construction and
possibility of applying several proof search strategies, like conditional
proof, proof by cases, proof by reductio ad absurdum etc."</LI>
</OL>

<P>
There are many variations in ND systems.
<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> page 32 believes that
two kinds of variations are especially important:
<OL>
<LI>The kind of basic items (data structures) on which inference rules are
defined.  These notes of a proof tree
"may be formulae (F-systems), sequents (S-systems),
sets of formulae (generalized clauses) or other structured data
(e.g. formulae with labels)".
<LI>The overall format of proof representation, which are generally
"trees (tree- or Gentzen-format or T-system...) or sequences
(linear- or Ja&#347;kowski format or L-system...)."
</OL>
The various Ja&#347;kowski systems for creating a linear system
of proof are popular.
Many different graphic devices have been added to show groupings; a
"simplified account, where each assumption is entered with the vertical
line which continues until this subproof is in force, is due to Fitch,
whereas [the] popular system of Copi applies bracketing to closed subproofs"
(<A HREF="mmset.html#Indrzejczak">[Indrzejczak]</A> page 42).

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="natural-deduction-metamath"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Natural Deduction in the Metamath Proof Explorer (MPE)</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MPE is fundamentally a <B>Hilbert-style</B> system.
That is, MPE is based on a
larger number of axioms (compared to natural deduction systems),
a very small set of rules of inference (modus ponens),
and the context is not changed
by the rules of inference in the middle of a proof.
That said, MPE proofs can be developed using the
natural deduction (ND) approach as originally developed by
Ja&#347;kowski and Gentzen.

<P>
The most common and recommended approach for applying ND
in MPE is to use deduction form and apply the MPE proven assertions
that are equivalent to ND rules.
For example, MPE's <A HREF="jca.html">jca</A>
is equivalent to ND rule
` /\ `I
(and-insertion).
See <A HREF="natded.html">MPE equivalents of typical
natural deduction (ND) rules</A> for a list of equivalences.
This approach for applying an ND approach within MPE
relies on Metamath's wff metavariables in an essential way, and
is described in more detail in the presentation
<A HREF="http://us.metamath.org/ocat/natded.pdf">"Natural Deductions in the
Metamath Proof Language" by Mario Carneiro, 2014</A>.

<P>
In this style
many steps are an implication, whose antecedent mimics the context
(` _G `)
of most ND systems.
To add an assumption, simply add it to the implication antecedent
(typically using <A HREF="simpr.html">simpr</A>), and use that
new antecedent for all later claims in the same scope.
If you wish to use an assertion in an ND hypothesis scope
that is outside the current ND hypothesis scope,
modify the assertion so that the
ND hypothesis assumption is added to its antecedent
(typically using <A HREF="adantr.html">adantr</A>).
Most proof steps will be proved using rules that have hypotheses
and results of the form
` ph `&nbsp;` -> ` ...

<P>
This is most easily understood by looking at some examples.
For an annotated example where some traditional ND rules are
directly applied in MPE, see
<A HREF="ex-natded5.2.html">ex-natded5.2</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3.html">ex-natded5.3</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.5.html">ex-natded5.5</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded5.7.html">ex-natded5.7</A>,

<A HREF="ex-natded5.13.html">ex-natded5.13</A>,
<A HREF="ex-natded9.20.html">ex-natded9.20</A>,
and
<A HREF="ex-natded9.26.html">ex-natded9.26</A>.

<P>
Only using specific natural deduction rules directly can lead to
very long proofs, for exactly the same reason that only using axioms directly
in Hilbert-style proofs can lead to long proofs.
If the goal is short and clear proofs, then it is better to reuse
already-proven proven assertions in deduction form than to start from
scratch each time.
For example, observe that proof
<A HREF="ex-natded5.8.html">ex-natded5.8</A> -
which is a line-for-line translation of directly using only common ND rules -
is much longer than
<A HREF="ex-natded5.8-2.html">ex-natded5.8-2</A>
(which directly reuses other proven statements)
and <A HREF="ex-natded5.2i.html">ex-natded5.2i</A>
(which doesn't worry about context).
Similarly, <A HREF="ex-natded5.3.html">ex-natded5.3</A> is longer than
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3-2.html">ex-natded5.3-2</A> and
<A HREF="ex-natded5.3i.html">ex-natded5.3i</A>.
Here are a few examples of proven assertions
that can be useful for proofs in deduction form:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ovmpt2d.html">ovmpt2d</A> - value of (2-operand) operation
    given maps-to notation.
<LI><A HREF="fvmptd.html">fvmptd</A> - value of (1-argument)
     function given maps-to notation
<LI><A HREF="breq1d">breq1d</A>, <A HREF="breqd">breqd</A>, and
    <A HREF="breq2d">breq2d</A> - relations with an equality
</UL>

<P>
In some cases the metamath.exe "minimize_with" proof command
can significantly shorten a
proof if the original only uses the equivalent of basic ND inference rules.
In practice, the simplest and clearest
approach to creating a proof depends on what is to be proved.

Metamath</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text above describes the most common
ways to implement natural deducation approaches in metamath and MPE.
However, there are alternative approaches for using natural deduction in
metamath.

<P> Alan Sare worked on an alternative within MPE, called virtual
deduction.  Much more information is available at <A
HREF="wvd1.html">wvd1</A>, and an example is at
<A
HREF="http://www.virtualdeduction.com/iunconlem2vd.html">iunconlem2vd</A>
[retrieved 11-Apr-2018]
 used to generate <A
HREF="iunconlem2.html">iunconlem2</A>.
  This approach essentially replaces
the outermost implication arrow ` -> ` with a different symbol ` ->. ` .
Alan Sare believed this change made it easier to
visualize proofs, while others disagree.  The <A
HREF="http://us.metamath.org/other.html#completeusersproof">completeusersproof
tool</A> is available which supports this alternative approach.

<P>
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lin&eacute; has developed a different
metamath-based system to support natural deduction system called

deduction</A> [retrieved 24-Aug-2018].

He reports that his system was inspired by a slide show,

Practically this system is equivalent to Mario Carneiro's work.

<P>
The deduction theorem (including the weak deduction theorem)
isn't used routinely in the Metamath Proof Explorer (set.mm) today,
since the alternatives are usually better.
However, it can be useful to understand cases where deduction form, and the
weak deduction theorem in particular, might provide an advantage.

<P>
As a hypothetical example, suppose we have developed a theory such as
complex numbers where all variable-type assumptions
such as ` A e. CC ` are
stated as $e hypotheses like this:

<P>
$e ` |- A e. CC ` <BR>
$e ` |- B e. CC ` <BR>
---------------- <BR>
$p ` |- ( A + B ) = ( B + A ) `

<P>
The proofs of such pure inferences are usually shorter than those of other
methods. Proving the closed theorem form often requires extra steps to
manipulate the order of the antecedents, and the deduction form adds a
small overhead to each step.

<p>
Suppose that after a chain of 100 such inferences, we discover that we need
a closed form, where the hypotheses become antecedents, for the last
theorem in the chain. One reason for needing a closed form is to be able
to use e.g. rexlimiv to add an existential quantifier such as
` E. x e. CC ph -> ` ..., which can be done only if ` x e. CC `
is an antecedent.

<P>
Our choices are (1) restate and reprove all 100 previous inferences as
closed theorems, (2) restate and reprove all 100 theorems in natural
deduction form (with ` ph -> ` prefixed to hypotheses and conclusion), or (3)
use the weak deduction theorem to convert the last theorem in the chain to
closed form. In this case, the weak deduction theorem will result in a
smaller overall file size than the other methods, and it will also be far
easier to implement since we only have to add 1 theorem rather than rewrite
and reprove 100 theorems.

<P>
In the early days of set.mm, many complex number theorems were available
only in inference form, which motivated the development of the weak
deduction theorem. Eventually, though, most complex number inferences
became needed in deduction (or closed) form, and the space-saving advantage
of the weak deduction theorem diminished. In particular, as the use of
Mario's natural deduction method became common, the number of proofs using
dedth decreased, e.g., from 232 in 2013 to 85 uses in August 2018.

<P>
As far as we know there is nothing in the literature
like either the weak deduction theorem or
Mario Carneiro's natural deduction method
(Mario Carneiro's method is presented in
<A HREF="http://us.metamath.org/ocat/natded.pdf">"Natural Deductions in the
Metamath Proof Language" by Mario Carneiro, 2014</A>).
In order to transform a hypothesis into an antecedent,
the literature's standard "Deduction
Theorem" requires metalogic outside of the notions provided by the axiom
system.
We instead generally prefer to use
Mario Carneiro's natural deduction method, then use the weak deduction theorem
in cases where that is difficult to apply, and only <i>then</i> use the
full standard deduction theorem as a last resort.

<P>
The weak deduction theorem does not require any additional metalogic but
converts an inference directly into a closed form theorem, with a rigorous
proof that uses only the axiom system. Unlike the standard Deduction
Theorem, there is no implicit external justification that we have to trust
in order to use it.

<P>
Mario's natural deduction method also does not require any new metalogical
notions. It avoids the Deduction Theorem's metalogic by prefixing the
hypotheses and conclusion of every would-be inference with a universal
antecedent, "ph -&gt;", from the very start.

<P>
We think it is impressive and satisfying that we can do so much in a
practical sense without stepping outside of our Hilbert-style axiom
system. Of course our axiomatization, which is in the form of schemes,
contains a metalogic of its own that we exploit. But this metalogic is
relatively simple, and for our Deduction Theorem alternatives, we primarily
use just the direct substitution of expressions for metavariables.

<P><HR NOSHADE SIZE=1><A NAME="definitions-deduction"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Definitions in deduction form</FONT></B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point it's probably useful to explain in more detail <I>why</I>
definitions do not require an antecedent in deduction form.

<P>
The actual purpose of the
` ph ` antecedent
is to introduce a hypothesis that may not
always be satisfiable without some assumptions (and the exact nature of
those assumptions is not known inside the theorem, so the generic
` ph `
is used). If we are dealing with a true abbreviation, just a short way to
write some symbols, then a definition
"D = ..." hypothesis will either be satisfied
by a similar hypothesis, or by theorem <A HREF="eqid.html">eqid</A>,
which will force the substitution of "..." for "D" in the rest of the theorem.
Since in any
case, the hypothesis can be discharged with no assumptions, the
" ` ph ` "
is not necessary.

<P>
Sometimes, we wish to discharge these hypotheses with something that isn't
just an abbreviation. For example, if ` J e. ( TopOn `` X ) ` , then
` X ` is the
base set of the topology ` J ` , so ` X = U. J `
(<A HREF="toponuni.html">toponuni</A>),
but since ` X = U. J ` is
not always true in this situation, we can't prove it without the hypothesis
` J e. ( TopOn `` X ) ` . What you have to do here, if you want to use a
theorem that has the hypothesis ` |- X = U. J ` (to prove some statement
` |- ` P(X)), is use
<A HREF="eqid.html">eqid</A> anyway, producing a proof of P(U. J), then use
( ` ph -> X = U. ` J ) and equality theorems to get
( ` ph -> ` ( P(X) ` <-> ` P(U. J) ) ), then
use the proof of |- P(U. J) to yield ` |- ( ph -> ` P(X) ` ) ` .
An example of this
procedure is the derivation of
<A HREF="ishaus2.html">ishaus2</A> (which has X = U. J given the
context) from
<A HREF="ishaus.html">ishaus</A> (which assumes X = U. J with no context).

<P>
The above procedure is always possible to do, but it is not always
convenient since many steps may be needed for the equality proof. In cases
where we specifically intend to discharge the assumption with something
other than eqid, we sometimes add ph -&gt; to the equalities as well. A common
example of this is in structure builder theorems, where we want to use a
self-referential expression for the left hand side. For example, we might
define a group by:
<BR><BR>

$e ` |- ( ph -> B = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
$e ` |- ( ph -> .+ = ` my-group-op(B) ` ) `<BR>
mygroupval $p ` |- ( ph -> ` MyGroup ` = { <. ( Base `` ndx ) , B >. , <. ( +g `` ndx ) , .+ >. } ) ` <BR>

<P>
Suppose that my-base-set is a complicated expression, and my-group-op(B)
has a lot of references to B, so the fully expanded
my-group-op(my-base-set) is really big, and we don't want to use it too
many times. In the same context, we then prove:
<BR><BR>

$e ` |- ( ph -> B = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
$e ` |- ( ph -> .+ = ` my-group-op(B) ` ) ` <BR>
mygroupbaslem $p ` |- ( ph -> ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
mygroupaddlem $p ` |- ( ph -> ( +g `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-group-op(B) ` ) ` <BR>

<P>
and now we can bootstrap the whole thing:
<BR><BR>

mygroupbas $p ` |- ( ph -> ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-base-set ` ) ` $= <BR>
1::eqid ` |- ( ph -> ` my-base-set ` = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
2::eqid ` |- ( ph -> ` my-group-op ` = ` my-group-op(my-base-set) ` ) ` <BR>
qed:1,2:mygroupbaslem ` |- ( ph -> ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
<BR>
mygroupadd $p ` |- ( ph -> ( +g `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-base-set ` ) ` $= <BR>
1::mygroupbas ` |- ( ph -> ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-base-set ` ) ` <BR>
2::eqid ` |- ( ph -> ` my-group-op( ` ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) ) = ` my-group-op( ` ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) ) ) ` <BR>
qed:1,2:mygroupbaslem ` |- ( ph -> ( +g `` ` MyGroup ` ) = ` my-group-op( ` ( Base `` ` MyGroup ` ) ) ) ` <BR>

<P>
Note that the contained references of my-group-op are now referencing
( Base &#96; MyGroup ), which makes this "definition" of a component of MyGroup
self-referential. But that was the goal, and we have mygroupbas so we
can expand it as necessary. A more elaborate version of this idea is done in
<A HREF="prdsval.html">prdsval</A>,
with prdsbas, prdsplusg, prdsmulr, etc pulling off components and
bootstrapping using the previous theorems.

<P>
Finally, there are a few places where ` ( ph -> X = ` ... ` ) `
definitions are
used by convention, specifically grppropd and other *propd theorems, and
isgrpd and other is*d theorems for structures.

<P>
As a rule of thumb: Use X = ... abbreviations unless you need to use a
non-identity abbreviation for X later.
