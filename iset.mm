This is part of an ongoing project to improve naming consistency.  If you have
suggestions for better names, let me know.

If you are keeping proofs outside the master version of this file, you can
make can make global substitutions into your local version by processing the
ones WITHOUT "Notes" in _reverse_ order.  The ones WITH "Notes" may have to be
processed manually.

                      4. Metamath syntax summary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  Syntax summary:

          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
  <label> $f ... $. - "Floating" hypothesis (i.e. variable type declaration)
  <label> $e ... $. - "Essential" hypothesis (i.e. a logical assumption for a
                      theorem or axiom)
  <label> $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
  <label> $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for defining the scope of the above statements
                      (except $a, $p which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $)
$(                  - Comments (may not be nested); see HELP LANGUAGE
                      for markup features
          $[ ... $] - Include a file

The above two-character sequences beginning with "$" are the only primitives
built into the Metamath language.  The only "logic" Metamath uses in its proof
verification algorithm is the substitution of expressions for variables while
checking for distinct variable violations.  Everything else, including the
axioms for logic, is defined in this database file.

Here is some more detail about the syntax.  There are two kinds of user-defined
syntax elements, called math symbols (or just symbols) and labels.  A symbol
may contain any non-whitespace printable character except "$".  A label may
contain only alphanumeric characters and the characters "."  (period), "-"
(hyphen), and "_" (underscore).  Tokens and labels are case-sensitive.  All
labels (except in proofs) must be distinct.  A label may not have the same name
as a token (to simplify the coding of certain parsers and translators).

  $c <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols that
      haven't been used before.
  $v <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of distinct symbols that haven't been used yet
      in the current scope (see ${ ... $} below).
  $d <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols
      previously declared with $v in current scope.  It means that
      substitutions into these symbols may not have variables in common.
  <label> $f <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $e <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $a <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $p <symbollist> $= <proof> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.  <proof> is either a
      whitespace-delimited sequence of previous labels (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /NORMAL) or a compressed proof (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /COMPRESSED).  After using SAVE PROOF, use
      WRITE SOURCE to save the database file to disk.
  ${ ... $}
      Block for scoping the above statements (except $a, $p which are forever
      active).  Currently, $c may not occur inside of a block.
$)
  $( <any text> $)
$(    Comment.  Note: <any text> may not contain adjacent "$" and ")"
      characters.
  $[ <filename> $]
      Insert contents of <filename> at this point.  If <filename> is current
      file or has been already been inserted, it will not be inserted again.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the LaTeX
and HTML rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note that ``
inside of grave accents is interpreted as a single ` .  A special comment
containing $ t defines LaTeX and HTML symbols.  See HELP LANGUAGE and
HELP HTML for other markup features in comments.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency.  The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in an Appendix of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be read
by humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF commands
described in the Metamath book (or the on-line HELP).

The Metamath program does not normally affect any content of this file (set.mm)
other than proofs, i.e. tokens between "$=" and "$.".  All other content is
user-created.  Proofs are created or modified with the PROVE command.

                          5. Other notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1. It is recommended that you be familiar with chapters 2 and 4 of the
'Metamath' book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2, 3 and 5
explain how to use the program.  Chapter 3 gives you an informal overview of
what this source file is all about.  Appendix A shows you the standard
mathematical symbols corresponding to some of the ASCII tokens in this file.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation.  To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"C_" for "is a subset of."  (HELP TEX tells you how to obtain a LaTeX output to
see the real mathematical symbols.)  Let me know if you have better suggestions
for naming ASCII tokens.

2. Logic and set theory provide a foundation for all of mathematics.  To learn
about them, you should study one or more of the references listed below.  The
textbooks provide a motivation for what we are doing, whereas Metamath lets you
see in detail all hidden and implicit steps.  Most standard theorems are
accompanied by citations.  Some closely followed texts include the following:

  Axioms of propositional calculus - [Margaris].
  Axioms of predicate calculus - [Megill] (System S3' in the article
      referenced).
  Theorems of propositional calculus - [WhiteheadRussell].
  Theorems of pure predicate calculus - [Margaris].
  Theorems of equality and substitution - [Monk2], [Tarski], [Megill].
  Axioms of set theory - [BellMachover].
  Development of set theory - [TakeutiZaring].  (The first part of [Quine]
      has a good explanation of the powerful device of "virtual" or
      class abstractions, which is essential to our development.)
  Construction of real and complex numbers - [Gleason]
  Theorems about real numbers - [Apostol]
  Intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics - [Bauer] is an sampling
    of theorems and arguments which give a flavor of constructive mathematics.
    [Heyting] is a more comprehensive treatment of intuitionistic logic.

3. Convention:  All $a statements starting with "|-" have labels
starting with "ax-" (axioms) or "df-" (definitions).  "ax-" corresponds
to what is traditionally called an axiom.  "df-" introduces new symbols
or a new relationship among symbols that can be eliminated; they always
extend the definition of a wff or class.  Metamath blindly treats $a
statements as new given facts but does not try to justify them.  The
mmj2 program will justify the definitions as sound, except for 5 (df-bi,
df-cleq, df-clel, df-clab, df-sbc) that require a more complex metalogical
justification by hand.

4. Our method of definition, the axioms for predicate calculus, and the
development of substitution are somewhat different from those found in standard
texts.  The axioms were designed for direct derivation of standard results
without excessive use of metatheorems.  (See Theorem 9.7 of [Megill] for a
rigorous justification.)  Typically we are minimalist when introducing new
definitions; they are introduced only when a clear advantage becomes apparent
for reducing the number of symbols, shortening proofs, etc.  We generally avoid
the introduction of gratuitous definitions because each one requires associated
theorems and additional elimination steps in proofs.

5. Where possible, the notation attempts to conform to modern conventions, with
variations due to our choice of the axiom system or to make proofs shorter.
Listed below are some important conventions and how they correspond to textbook
language.  The notation is usually explained in more detail when first
introduced.

  Typically, Greek letters (ph = phi, ps = psi, ch = chi, etc.) are used for
      propositional (wff) variables; x,y,z,... for individual (i.e. set)
      variables; and A,B,C,... for class variables.
  "|-", meaning "It is provable that," is the first token of all assertions
      and hypotheses that aren't syntax constructions.  This is a standard
      convention in logic.  For us, it also prevents any ambiguity with
      statements that are syntax constructions, such as "wff -. ph".
  "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." should be read "Assume variable x is
      (effectively) not free in wff phi."  Literally, this says "Assume it is
      provable that phi implies for all x phi."
  "|- ( -. A. x x = y -> ..." should be read "If x and y are distinct
      variables, then..."  This antecedent provides us with a technical
      device (called a "distinctor" in [Megill]) to avoid the need for the
      $d statement early in our development of predicate calculus, permitting
      unrestricted substitituions as conceptually simple as those in
      propositional calculus.  However, the $d eventually becomes a
      requirement, and after that this device is rarely used.
  "[ y / x ] ph" should be read "the wff that results when y is properly
      substituted for x in ph."
  "$d x y $." should be read "Assume x and y are distinct variables."
  "$d x ph $." should be read "Assume x does not occur in phi $."  Sometimes
      a theorem is proved with "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." in place of
      "$d x ph $." when a more general result is desired; ~ ax-17 can be used
      to derive the $d version.  For an example of how to get from the $d
      version back to the $e version, see the proof of ~ euf from ~ df-eu .
  "$d x A $." should be read "Assume x is not a variable occurring in class A."
  "$d x A $.  $d x ps $.  $e |- ( x = A -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) $." is an idiom
      often used instead of explicit substitution, meaning "Assume psi results
      from the substitution of A for x in phi."
  "$e |- A e. _V $." should be read "Assume class A is a set (i.e. exists)."
      This is a convenient convention used by [Quine].
  "$d x y $.  $e |- y e. A -> A. x y e. A $." should be read "Assume x is
      (effectively) not a free variable in class A."
  "`' R" should be read "converse of (relation) R" and is the same as the more
      standard notation R^{-1}.
  "( f ` x )" should be read "the value of function f at x" and is the same as
      the more familiar f(x).
  The Deduction Theorem of standard logic is never used.  Instead, in set
      theory, we use other tricks to make a $e hypothesis become an antecedent.
      See the comment for theorem ~ dedth below.

           6. Acceptable shorter proofs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Shorter proofs are welcome, and any shorter proof I accept will be acknowledged
in the theorem's description.  However, in some cases a proof may be "shorter"
or not depending on how it is formatted.  This section provides general
guidelines.

Usually I will automatically accept shorter proofs that (1) shorten the set.mm
file (with compressed proofs), (2) reduce the size of the HTML file generated
with SHOW STATEMENT xx / HTML, (3) use only existing, unmodified theorems in
the database (the order of theorems may be changed, though), and (4) use no
additional axioms.

Usually I will also automatically accept a _new_ theorem that is used to
shorten multiple proofs, if the total size of set.mm (including the comment of
the new theorem, not including the acknowledgment) decreases as a result.

In borderline cases, I typically place more importance on the number of
compressed proof steps and less on the length of the label section (since the
names are in principal arbitrary).  If two proofs have the same number of
compressed proof steps, I will typically give preference to the one with the
smaller number of different labels, or if these numbers are the same, the proof
with the fewest number of characters that the proofs happen to have by chance
when label lengths are included.

A few theorems have a longer proof than necessary in order to avoid the use of
certain axioms, for pedagogical purposes, and for other reasons.  Usually this
is clear from the theorem's description.  For example, id1 shows a proof
directly from axioms.  Shorter proofs for such cases won't be accepted, of
course, unless the criteria described continues to be satisfied.

    $( (_Note_:  This inference rule and the next one, ~ idi , will normally
       never appear in a completed proof.  It can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic - please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The metamath program's Proof Assistant requires proofs to be developed
       backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no mechanism that
       lets the user to work on isolated subproofs.  This inference provides a
       workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any point in a
       proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the side, for
       later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:  (1) Assign this inference to any unknown step in the
       proof.  Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       'assign last' can be used.  This step will be replicated in hypothesis
       dummylink.1, from where the development of the main proof can continue.
       (2) Develop the independent subproof backwards from hypothesis
       dummylink.2.  If desired, use a 'let' command to pre-assign the
       conclusion of the independent subproof to dummylink.2.  (3) After the
       independent subproof is complete, use 'improve all' to assign it
       automatically to an unknown step in the main proof that matches it.  (4)
       After the entire proof is complete, use 'minimize *' to clean up
       (discard) all dummylink references automatically.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  (Contributed by NM, 7-Feb-2006.) $)

     and rule ~ ax-mp ) can be thought of as asserting formulas that are
     universally "true" when their variables are replaced by any combination of
     "true" and "false."  Propositional calculus was first formalized by Frege
     in 1879, using as his axioms (in addition to rule ~ ax-mp ) the wffs
     ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , ~ pm2.04 , ~ con3 , ~ notnot2 , and ~ notnot1 .  Around
     1930, Lukasiewicz simplified the system by eliminating the third (which
     follows from the first two, as you can see by looking at the proof of
     ~ pm2.04 ) and replacing the last three with our ~ ax-3 .  (Thanks to Ted
     Ulrich for this information.)

     The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
     Tautologies can be proved very simply using truth tables, based on the
     true/false interpretation of propositional calculus.  To do this, we
     assign all possible combinations of true and false to the wff variables
     and verify that the result (using the rules described in ~ wi and ~ wn )
     always evaluates to true.  This is called the _semantic_ approach.  Our
     approach is called the _syntactic_ approach, in which everything is
     derived from axioms.  A metatheorem called the Completeness Theorem for
     Propositional Calculus shows that the two approaches are equivalent and
     even provides an algorithm for automatically generating syntactic proofs
     from a truth table.  Those proofs, however, tend to be long, since truth
     tables grow exponentially with the number of variables, and the much
     shorter proofs that we show here were found manually.  (Contributed by NM,
     5-Aug-1993.) $)

     propositional calculus.  It "distributes" an antecedent over two
     consequents.  This axiom was part of Frege's original system and is known
     as _Frege_ in the literature.  It is also proved as Theorem *2.77 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other direction of this axiom also turns
     out to be true, as demonstrated by ~ pm5.41 .  (Contributed by NM,

       true."  This rule is sometimes called "detachment," since it detaches
       the minor premise from the major premise.

  $( This is our first definition, which introduces and defines the
     biconditional connective ` <-> ` .  We define a wff of the form
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an abbreviation for
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

     Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a
     separate symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as."  Instead, we will
     later use the biconditional connective for this purpose, as it allows us
     to use logic to manipulate definitions directly.  For an example of such a
     definition, see ~ df-3or .  This greatly simplifies many proofs since it
     eliminates the need for a separate mechanism for introducing and
     eliminating definitions.  Of course, we cannot use this mechanism to
     define the biconditional itself, since it hasn't been introduced yet.
     Instead, we use a more general form of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the defining
     expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the previously
     proved theorem ~ biijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to prove any
     statement expressed in the original language that can't be proved from the
     original axioms, because if we simply replace each instance of ~ df-bi in
     the proof with the corresponding ~ biijust instance, we will end up with a
     proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are are not strengthening the language.  To indicate
     this fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just for human readability.)

     ~ df-bi itself is a conjunction of two implications (to avoid using the
     biconditional in its own definition), but once we have the biconditional,
     we can prove ~ dfbi2 which uses the biconditional instead.

$( Although the Intuitionistic Logic Explorer is primarily for theorems which
   hold in intuitionistic logic, we also have some classical theorems in order
   to constrast them with similar intuitionistic ones. Our goal is to move
   such classical logic to the end of the file, after we've had a chance to
   complete our development of constructive mathemetics.  In practice,
   this has been a gradual process of replacing classical proofs with
   intuitionistic ones (where possible), moving classical proofs later
   in the file, or removing classical proofs which are unused and not
   especially important to contrast classical and intuitionistic results. $)

  $( Axiom _Transp_.  Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49.

     We take this as an additional axiom which transforms intuitionistic logic
     to classical logic, but there are others which would have the same effect,
     including ~ exmid , ~ peirce , or ~ notnot2 .

     This axiom swaps or "transposes" the order of the consequents when
     negation is removed.  An informal example is that the statement "if there
     are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies the statement "if it
     is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This axiom is called _Transp_
     or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem
     *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also use the term
     "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is advised that
     in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a different
     technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free
     in ` ph ` ".  Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the
     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` , even though ` x `
     would be considered free in the usual textbook definition, because the
     value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot affect the truth of the
     expression (and thus substitution will not change the result).

     at this point: the predicate calculus axioms for ` e. ` apply to any
     arbitrary binary predicate symbol.  "Non-logical" means that the predicate
     is presumed to have additional properties beyond the realm of predicate
     calculus, although these additional properties are not specified by
     predicate calculus itself but rather by the axioms of a theory (in our
     case set theory) added to predicate calculus.  "Binary" means that the
     predicate has two arguments.

     (Instead of introducing ~ wel as an axiomatic statement, as was done in an
     older version of this database, we introduce it by "proving" a special
     case of set theory's more general ~ wcel .  This lets us avoid overloading
     the ` e. ` connective, thus preventing ambiguity that would complicate
     certain Metamath parsers.  However, logically ~ wel is considered to be a
     primitive syntax, even though here it is artificially "derived" from
     ~ wcel .  Note:  To see the proof steps of this syntax proof, type "show
     proof wel /all" in the Metamath program.)  (Contributed by NM,

  $( Axiom of Equality.  One of the equality and substitution axioms of
     predicate calculus with equality.  This is similar to, but not quite, a
     transitive law for equality (proved later as ~ equtr ).  Axiom scheme C8'
     in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom C7 of
     [Monk2] p. 105.

     Axioms ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 are the axioms having to do with equality,
     substitution, and logical properties of our binary predicate ` e. ` (which
     later in set theory will mean "is a member of").  Note that all axioms
     except ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 are still valid even when ` x ` , ` y ` , and
     ` z ` are replaced with the same variable because they do not have any
     distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Distinct variable
     restrictions are required for ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 only.  (Contributed by
     NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)
  ax-8 $a |- ( x = y -> ( x = z -> y = z ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Substitution.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Appears as Lemma L12 in
     [Megill] p. 445 (p. 12 of the preprint).

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-10o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from
     ~ ax-10o as theorem ~ ax10 .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)
  ax-10 $a |- ( A. x x = y -> A. y y = x ) $.

  $( Axiom of Variable Substitution.  One of the 5 equality axioms of predicate
     calculus.  The final consequent ` A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` is a way of
     expressing " ` y ` substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` " (cf. ~ sb6 ).  It
     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,
     from which it can be proved by cases.

     In classical logic, ~ ax-11o can be derived from this axiom, as can be
     seen at ~ ax11o .  However, the current proof of ~ ax11o is not valid
     intuitionistically.

     In classical logic, this axiom is _metalogically_ independent from the
     others, but not _logically_ independent.  Lack of logical independence
     means that if the wff expression substituted for ` ph ` contains no wff
     variables, the resulting statement _can_ be proved without invoking this
     axiom.  The current proofs of this are not valid in intuitionistic logic,
     however.  Specifically, we can prove any wff-variable-free instance of
     axiom ~ ax-11o (from which the ~ ax-11 instance follows by theorem
     ~ ax11 .)  The proof is by induction on formula length, using ~ ax11eq and
     ~ ax11el for the basis steps and ~ ax11indn , ~ ax11indi , and ~ ax11inda
     for the induction steps.  Many of those theorems rely on classical logic
     for their proofs.

     Variants of this axiom which are equivalent in classical logic but which
     have not been shown to be equivalent for intuitionistic logic are
     ~ ax11v , ~ ax11v2 and ~ ax-11o .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)
  ax-11 $a |- ( x = y -> ( A. y ph -> A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that
     whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true,
     then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z `
     is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear
     in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by
     cases.

     This axiom has been modified from the original ~ ax-12 for compatibility
     with intuitionistic logic.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro,
     31-Jan-2015.) $)

                 A. z ( x = y -> A. z x = y ) ) ) $.

  $( Axiom of Specialization.  A quantified wff implies the wff without a
     quantifier (i.e. an instance, or special case, of the generalized wff).
     In other words if something is true for all ` x ` , it is true for any
     specific ` x ` (that would typically occur as a free variable in the wff
     substituted for ` ph ` ).  (A free variable is one that does not occur in
     the scope of a quantifier: ` x ` and ` y ` are both free in ` x = y ` ,
     but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .)  Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski]
     p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77).

     Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a
     weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule
     ~ ax-gen .  Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-12 ,
     ~ ax-15 , ~ ax-16 , and ~ ax-17 .

     Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose
     a variable different from ` x ` for the special case.  For use, that
     requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later
     after we introduce the definition of proper substitution - see ~ stdpc4 .

     The relationship of this axiom to other predicate logic axioms is
     different than in the classical case.  In particular, the current proof of
     ~ ax4 (which derives ~ ax-4 from certain other axioms) relies on ~ ax-3
     and so is not valid intuitionistically.  (Contributed by NM,

       This inference, along with our many variants is used to implement a
       metatheorem called "Rule C" that is given in many logic textbooks.  See,
       for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C in [Margaris] p. 40, or
       Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF
       p. 65) at ~ http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~~jlh/primer/hirst.pdf .

       In informal proofs, the statement "Let C be an element such that..."
       almost always means an implicit application of Rule C.

       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `
       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has
       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( ` C ` ) ` as a hypothesis for the
       proof where C is a new (ficticious) constant not appearing previously in
       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The
       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.

       We cannot do this in Metamath directly.  Instead, we use the original
       ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the
       proof.  We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the
       theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` .  Then we apply
       ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` .  Finally, we separately
       prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at
       the final theorem ` ps ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)  (Revised

       This proof is similar to Tarski's and makes use of a dummy variable
       ` y ` .  It also works in intuitionistic logic, unlike some other
       possible ways of proving this theorem.  (Contributed by NM,

  $( Define proper substitution.  Remark 9.1 in [Megill] p. 447 (p. 15 of the
     preprint).  For our notation, we use ` [ y / x ] ph ` to mean "the wff
     that results when ` y ` is properly substituted for ` x ` in the wff
     ` ph ` ."  We can also use ` [ y / x ] ph ` in place of the "free for"
     side condition used in traditional predicate calculus; see, for example,
     ~ stdpc4 .

     Our notation was introduced in Haskell B. Curry's _Foundations of
     Mathematical Logic_ (1977), p. 316 and is frequently used in textbooks of
     lambda calculus and combinatory logic.  This notation improves the common
     but ambiguous notation, " ` ph ( y ) ` is the wff that results when ` y `
     is properly substituted for ` x ` in ` ph ( x ) ` ."  For example, if the
     original ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = y ` , then ` ph ( y ) ` is ` y = y ` , from
     which we obtain that ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = x ` .  So what exactly does
     ` ph ( x ) ` mean?  Curry's notation solves this problem.

     In most books, proper substitution has a somewhat complicated recursive
     definition with multiple cases based on the occurrences of free and bound
     variables in the wff.  Instead, we use a single formula that is exactly
     equivalent and gives us a direct definition.  We later prove that our
     definition has the properties we expect of proper substitution (see
     theorems ~ sbequ , ~ sbcom2 and ~ sbid2v ).

     Note that our definition is valid even when ` x ` and ` y ` are replaced
     with the same variable, as ~ sbid shows.  We achieve this by having ` x `
     free in the first conjunct and bound in the second.  We can also achieve
     this by using a dummy variable, as the alternate definition ~ dfsb7 shows
     (which some logicians may prefer because it doesn't mix free and bound
     variables).  Another alternate definition which uses a dummy variable is
     ~ dfsb7a .

     When ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct, we can express proper substitution with
     the simpler expressions of ~ sb5 and ~ sb6 .

     In classical logic, we have additional equivalent definitions ~ dfsb2 and
     ~ dfsb3 , but we do not have intuitionistic proofs that those are
     equivalent.

     There are no restrictions on any of the variables, including what
     variables may occur in wff ` ph ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

       axiom, but without ~ ax-17 we lose the more powerful metalogic that

     the preprint).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of
     [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this
     theorem more easily, think of " ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ..." as informally
     meaning "if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then..."  The
     antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and
     ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some

       Proposition 7.53 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 53.)  It turns out that this is
       actually a weaker assertion, as can be seen by expanding out the formal
       definitions.  This theorem shows that the erroneous definition can be
       repaired by conjoining ` A. x E* y ph ` as an additional condition.  The
       correct definition apparently has never been published.  ( ` E* ` means
       "exists at most one.") (Contributed by NM, 26-Oct-2003.) $)

In classical logic, the predicate logic connectives are connected with

has some such connections but they are fewer and some of the ones which
are biconditionals in classical logic only hold in one direction in
intuitionistic logic.

In classical logic, we can talk about the exclusive-or of ` ph ` and ` ps ` ,
which can be represented by ` -. ( ph <-> ps ) ` or
` ( ph \/ ps ) /\ ( -. ph \/ -. ps ) `
(which are equivalent in classical logic but not intuitionistic logic).
We do not (yet at least) have an intuitionistic theory of exclusive or
(or, relatedly at least in concept, existential uniqueness a la ~ df-eu ),
but here we collect theorems which depend on ~ ax-3 for their proof and many
of which probably do not hold intuitionistically.

There are also a variety of related results about pairs of propositions
which are both true, both false, one
true and one false, and the like, which are at least in general terms
also part of this exclusive-or family. Many are expressed in terms
of the biconditional and negation.
