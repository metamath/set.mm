This is part of an ongoing project to improve naming consistency.  If you have
suggestions for better names, let me know.

If you are keeping proofs outside the master version of this file, you can
make global substitutions into your local version by processing the
ones WITHOUT "Notes" in _reverse_ order.  The ones WITH "Notes" may have to be
processed manually.

                      4. Metamath syntax summary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  Syntax summary:

          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
  <label> $f ... $. - "Floating" hypothesis (i.e. variable type declaration)
  <label> $e ... $. - "Essential" hypothesis (i.e. a logical assumption for a
                      theorem or axiom)
  <label> $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
  <label> $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for defining the scope of the above statements
                      (except $a, $p which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $)
$(                  - Comments (may not be nested); see HELP LANGUAGE
                      for markup features
          $[ ... $] - Include a file

The above two-character sequences beginning with "$" are the only primitives
built into the Metamath language.  The only "logic" Metamath uses in its proof
verification algorithm is the substitution of expressions for variables while
checking for distinct variable violations.  Everything else, including the
axioms for logic, is defined in this database file.

Here is some more detail about the syntax.  There are two kinds of user-defined
syntax elements, called math symbols (or just symbols) and labels.  A symbol
may contain any non-whitespace printable character except "$".  A label may
contain only alphanumeric characters and the characters "."  (period), "-"
(hyphen), and "_" (underscore).  Tokens and labels are case-sensitive.  All
labels (except in proofs) must be distinct.  A label may not have the same name
as a token (to simplify the coding of certain parsers and translators).

  $c <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols that
      haven't been used before.
  $v <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of distinct symbols that haven't been used yet
      in the current scope (see ${ ... $} below).
  $d <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols
      previously declared with $v in current scope.  It means that
      substitutions into these symbols may not have variables in common.
  <label> $f <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $e <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $a <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $p <symbollist> $= <proof> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.  <proof> is either a
      whitespace-delimited sequence of previous labels (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /NORMAL) or a compressed proof (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /COMPRESSED).  After using SAVE PROOF, use
      WRITE SOURCE to save the database file to disk.
  ${ ... $}
      Block for scoping the above statements (except $a, $p which are forever
      active).  Currently, $c may not occur inside of a block.
$)
  $( <any text> $)
$(    Comment.  Note: <any text> may not contain adjacent "$" and ")"
      characters.
  $[ <filename> $]
      Insert contents of <filename> at this point.  If <filename> is current
      file or has been already been inserted, it will not be inserted again.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the LaTeX
and HTML rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note that ``
inside of grave accents is interpreted as a single ` .  A special comment
containing $ t defines LaTeX and HTML symbols.  See HELP LANGUAGE and
HELP HTML for other markup features in comments.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency.  The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in an Appendix of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be read
by humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF commands
described in the Metamath book (or the on-line HELP).

The Metamath program does not normally affect any content of this file (set.mm)
other than proofs, i.e. tokens between "$=" and "$.".  All other content is
user-created.  Proofs are created or modified with the PROVE command.

                          5. Other notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1. It is recommended that you be familiar with chapters 2 and 4 of the
'Metamath' book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2, 3 and 5
explain how to use the program.  Chapter 3 gives you an informal overview of
what this source file is all about.  Appendix A shows you the standard
mathematical symbols corresponding to some of the ASCII tokens in this file.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation.  To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"C_" for "is a subset of."  (HELP TEX tells you how to obtain a LaTeX output to
see the real mathematical symbols.)  Let me know if you have better suggestions
for naming ASCII tokens.

2. Logic and set theory provide a foundation for all of mathematics.  To learn
about them, you should study one or more of the references listed below.  The
textbooks provide a motivation for what we are doing, whereas Metamath lets you
see in detail all hidden and implicit steps.  Most standard theorems are
accompanied by citations.  Some closely followed texts include the following:

  Axioms of propositional calculus - [Margaris].
  Axioms of predicate calculus - [Megill] (System S3' in the article
      referenced).
  Theorems of propositional calculus - [WhiteheadRussell].
  Theorems of pure predicate calculus - [Margaris].
  Theorems of equality and substitution - [Monk2], [Tarski], [Megill].
  Axioms of set theory - [BellMachover].
  Development of set theory - [TakeutiZaring].  (The first part of [Quine]
      has a good explanation of the powerful device of "virtual" or
      class abstractions, which is essential to our development.)
  Construction of real and complex numbers - [Gleason]
  Theorems about real numbers - [Apostol]
  Intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics - [Bauer] is an sampling
    of theorems and arguments which give a flavor of constructive mathematics.
    [Heyting] is a more comprehensive treatment of intuitionistic logic.

3. Convention:  All $a statements starting with "|-" have labels
starting with "ax-" (axioms) or "df-" (definitions).  "ax-" corresponds
to what is traditionally called an axiom.  "df-" introduces new symbols
or a new relationship among symbols that can be eliminated; they always
extend the definition of a wff or class.  Metamath blindly treats $a
statements as new given facts but does not try to justify them.  The
mmj2 program will justify the definitions as sound, except for 5 (df-bi,
df-cleq, df-clel, df-clab, df-sbc) that require a more complex metalogical
justification by hand.

4. Our method of definition, the axioms for predicate calculus, and the
development of substitution are somewhat different from those found in standard
texts.  The axioms were designed for direct derivation of standard results
without excessive use of metatheorems.  (See Theorem 9.7 of [Megill] for a
rigorous justification.)  Typically we are minimalist when introducing new
definitions; they are introduced only when a clear advantage becomes apparent
for reducing the number of symbols, shortening proofs, etc.  We generally avoid
the introduction of gratuitous definitions because each one requires associated
theorems and additional elimination steps in proofs.

5. Where possible, the notation attempts to conform to modern conventions, with
variations due to our choice of the axiom system or to make proofs shorter.
Listed below are some important conventions and how they correspond to textbook
language.  The notation is usually explained in more detail when first
introduced.

  Typically, Greek letters (ph = phi, ps = psi, ch = chi, etc.) are used for
      propositional (wff) variables; x,y,z,... for individual (i.e. set)
      variables; and A,B,C,... for class variables.
  "|-", meaning "It is provable that," is the first token of all assertions
      and hypotheses that aren't syntax constructions.  This is a standard
      convention in logic.  For us, it also prevents any ambiguity with
      statements that are syntax constructions, such as "wff -. ph".
  "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." should be read "Assume variable x is
      (effectively) not free in wff phi."  Literally, this says "Assume it is
      provable that phi implies for all x phi."
  "|- ( -. A. x x = y -> ..." should be read "If x and y are distinct
      variables, then..."  This antecedent provides us with a technical
      device (called a "distinctor" in [Megill]) to avoid the need for the
      $d statement early in our development of predicate calculus, permitting
      unrestricted substitituions as conceptually simple as those in
      propositional calculus.  However, the $d eventually becomes a
      requirement, and after that this device is rarely used.
  "[ y / x ] ph" should be read "the wff that results when y is properly
      substituted for x in ph."
  "$d x y $." should be read "Assume x and y are distinct variables."
  "$d x ph $." should be read "Assume x does not occur in phi $."  Sometimes
      a theorem is proved with "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." in place of
      "$d x ph $." when a more general result is desired; ~ ax-17 can be used
      to derive the $d version.  For an example of how to get from the $d
      version back to the $e version, see the proof of ~ euf from ~ df-eu .
  "$d x A $." should be read "Assume x is not a variable occurring in class A."
  "$d x A $.  $d x ps $.  $e |- ( x = A -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) $." is an idiom
      often used instead of explicit substitution, meaning "Assume psi results
      from the substitution of A for x in phi."
  "$e |- A e. _V $." should be read "Assume class A is a set (i.e. exists)."
      This is a convenient convention used by [Quine].
  "$d x y $.  $e |- y e. A -> A. x y e. A $." should be read "Assume x is
      (effectively) not a free variable in class A."
  "`' R" should be read "converse of (relation) R" and is the same as the more
      standard notation R^{-1}.
  "( f ` x )" should be read "the value of function f at x" and is the same as
      the more familiar f(x).
  The Deduction Theorem of standard logic is never used.  Instead, in set
      theory, we use other tricks to make a $e hypothesis become an antecedent.
      See the comment for theorem ~ dedth below.

           6. Acceptable shorter proofs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Shorter proofs are welcome, and any shorter proof I accept will be acknowledged
in the theorem's description.  However, in some cases a proof may be "shorter"
or not depending on how it is formatted.  This section provides general
guidelines.

Usually I will automatically accept shorter proofs that (1) shorten the set.mm
file (with compressed proofs), (2) reduce the size of the HTML file generated
with SHOW STATEMENT xx / HTML, (3) use only existing, unmodified theorems in
the database (the order of theorems may be changed, though), and (4) use no
additional axioms.

Usually I will also automatically accept a _new_ theorem that is used to
shorten multiple proofs, if the total size of set.mm (including the comment of
the new theorem, not including the acknowledgment) decreases as a result.

In borderline cases, I typically place more importance on the number of
compressed proof steps and less on the length of the label section (since the
names are in principal arbitrary).  If two proofs have the same number of
compressed proof steps, I will typically give preference to the one with the
smaller number of different labels, or if these numbers are the same, the proof
with the fewest number of characters that the proofs happen to have by chance
when label lengths are included.

A few theorems have a longer proof than necessary in order to avoid the use of
certain axioms, for pedagogical purposes, and for other reasons.  Usually this
is clear from the theorem's description.  For example, id1 shows a proof
directly from axioms.  Shorter proofs for such cases won't be accepted, of
course, unless the criteria described continues to be satisfied.

    $( (_Note_:  This inference rule and the next one, ~ idi , will normally
       never appear in a completed proof.  It can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic - please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The metamath program's Proof Assistant requires proofs to be developed
       backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no mechanism that
       lets the user to work on isolated subproofs.  This inference provides a
       workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any point in a
       proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the side, for
       later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:  (1) Assign this inference to any unknown step in the
       proof.  Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       'assign last' can be used.  This step will be replicated in hypothesis
       dummylink.1, from where the development of the main proof can continue.
       (2) Develop the independent subproof backwards from hypothesis
       dummylink.2.  If desired, use a 'let' command to pre-assign the
       conclusion of the independent subproof to dummylink.2.  (3) After the
       independent subproof is complete, use 'improve all' to assign it
       automatically to an unknown step in the main proof that matches it.  (4)
       After the entire proof is complete, use 'minimize *' to clean up
       (discard) all dummylink references automatically.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  (Contributed by NM, 7-Feb-2006.) $)

  $( Axiom _Simp_.  Axiom A1 of [Margaris] p. 49.  One of the axioms of
     propositional calculus.  This axiom is called _Simp_ or "the principle of
     simplification" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.02 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 100) because "it enables us to pass from the joint
     assertion of ` ph ` and ` ps ` to the assertion of ` ph ` simply."

     The theorems of propositional calculus are also called _tautologies_.
     Although classical propositional logic tautologies can be proved using
     truth tables, there is no similarly simple system for intuitionistic
     propositional logic, so proving tautologies from axioms is the preferred
     approach.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

     Theorem *2.77 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 108.  The other direction of this

   The results in this section are based on implication only, and only use
   ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-mp .
   In an implication, the wff before the arrow is called the "antecedent" and
   the wff after the arrow is called the "consequent."

   We will use the following descriptive terms very loosely:  A "closed form"
   or "tautology" has no $e hypotheses.  An "inference" has one or more $e
   hypotheses.  A "deduction" is an inference in which the hypotheses and the
   conclusion share the same antecedent.

       prefixed with the same antecedent.  This allows us to use the theorem in
       places where (in traditional textbook formalizations) the standard

       an "inference" and suffix its label with "i"; compare theorem ~ a1i .
       Finally, a "theorem" would be the form with no hypotheses; in this case
       the "theorem" form would be the original axiom ~ ax-1 .  We usually show

  $( This is our first definition, which introduces and defines the
     biconditional connective ` <-> ` .  We define a wff of the form
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an abbreviation for
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

     Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a
     separate symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as."  Instead, we will
     later use the biconditional connective for this purpose, as it allows us
     to use logic to manipulate definitions directly.  For an example of such a
     definition, see ~ df-3or .  This greatly simplifies many proofs since it
     eliminates the need for a separate mechanism for introducing and
     eliminating definitions.  Of course, we cannot use this mechanism to
     define the biconditional itself, since it hasn't been introduced yet.
     Instead, we use a more general form of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the defining
     expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the previously
     proved theorem ~ biijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to prove any
     statement expressed in the original language that can't be proved from the
     original axioms, because if we simply replace each instance of ~ df-bi in
     the proof with the corresponding ~ biijust instance, we will end up with a
     proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are are not strengthening the language.  To indicate
     this fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just for human readability.)

     ~ df-bi itself is a conjunction of two implications (to avoid using the
     biconditional in its own definition), but once we have the biconditional,
     we can prove ~ dfbi2 which uses the biconditional instead.

     Other definitions of the biconditional, such as ~ dfbi3dc , only hold for
     decidable propositions, not all propositions.  (Contributed by NM,

   Many theorems of logic hold in intuitionistic logic just as they do in
   classical (non-inuitionistic) logic, for all propositions. Other theorems
   only hold for decidable propositions, such as the law of the excluded
   middle ( ~ df-dc ), double negation elimination ( ~ notnotdc ), or
   contraposition ( ~ condc ). Our goal is to prove all well-known
   or important classical theorems, but with suitable decidability
   conditions so that the proofs follow from intuitionistic axioms.
   This section is focused on such proofs, given decidability conditions.

  For classical logic, truth tables can be used to define propositional
  logic operations, by showing the results of those operations for all
  possible combinations of true ( ` T. ` ) and false ( ` F. ` ).

  Although the intuitionistic logic connectives are not as simply defined,
  ` T. ` and ` F. ` do play similar roles as in classical logic and most
  theorems from classical logic continue to hold.

  Here we show that our definitions and axioms produce equivalent results for
  ` T. ` and ` F. ` as we would get from truth tables for
  ` /\ ` (conjunction aka logical 'and') ~ wa ,
  ` \/ ` (disjunction aka logical inclusive 'or') ~ wo ,
  ` -> ` (implies) ~ wi ,
  ` -. ` (not) ~ wn ,

                Stoic logic indemonstrables (Chrysippus of Soli)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic.
  The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest
  logicians of antiquity.
  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses
  on propositional logic,
  though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle.
  Jan Lukasiewicz reports,
  "For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident
  that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic"
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).
  For more about Aristotle's system, see barbara and related theorems.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in
  general it is difficult to assign specific
  ideas to specific thinkers.
  The indemonstrables are described in, for example,
  [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5.
  These indemonstrables are
  modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp ,
  modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto ,
  modus ponendo tollens I ~ mpto1 ,
  modus ponendo tollens II ~ mpto2 , and
  modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtp-xor .
  The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section
  we prove the other three.
  Since we assume or prove all of indemonstrables, the system of logic we use
  here is as at least as strong as the set of Stoic indemonstrables.
  Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtp-xor originally used exclusive-or,
  but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred
  to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtp-or .
  This set of indemonstrables is not the entire system of Stoic logic.

       rule A3 in [Hitchcock] p. 5.  Sanford describes this rule second (after
       ~ mpto2 ) as a "safer, and these days much more common" version of modus

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free
     in ` ph ` ".  Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the
     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` , even though ` x `
     would be considered free in the usual textbook definition, because the
     value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot affect the truth of the
     expression (and thus substitution will not change the result).

     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from

     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,
     from which it can be proved by cases.

     Variants of this axiom which are equivalent in classical logic but which
     have not been shown to be equivalent for intuitionistic logic are

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that
     whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true,
     then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z `
     is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear
     in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by

     with intuitionistic logic.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro,

  $( Axiom of bundling.  The general idea of this axiom is that two variables
     are either distinct or non-distinct.  That idea could be expressed as
     ` A. z z = x \/ -. A. z z = x ` .  However, we instead choose an axiom
     which has many of the same consequences, but which is different with
     respect to a universe which contains only one object. ` A. z z = x ` holds
     if ` z ` and ` x ` are the same variable, likewise for ` z ` and ` y ` ,
     and ` A. x A. z ( x = y -> A. z x = y ) ` holds if ` z ` is distinct from
     the others (and the universe has at least two objects).

     As with other statements of the form "x is decidable (either true or
     false)", this does not entail the full Law of the Excluded Middle (which
     is the proposition that all statements are decidable), but instead merely
     the assertion that particular kinds of statements are decidable (or in
     this case, an assertion similar to decidability).

     This axiom is similar to ~ ax-i12 , but appears to be stronger.  At least
     for now, we keep them both as distinct axioms, but they serve similar
     purposes.

     The reason we call this "bundling" is that a statement without a distinct
     variable constraint "bundles" together two statements, one in which the
     two variables are the same and one in which they are different.

     but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .)  Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski]
     p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77).

     Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a
     weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule
     ~ ax-gen .  Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-12 ,
     ~ ax-16 , and ~ ax-17 .

     Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose
     a variable different from ` x ` for the special case.  For use, that
     requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later
     after we introduce the definition of proper substitution - see ~ stdpc4 .

     the predicate has two arguments.  In a system of predicate calculus with
     equality, like ours, equality is not usually considered to be a

       This inference, along with our many variants is used to implement a
       metatheorem called "Rule C" that is given in many logic textbooks.  See,
       for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C in [Margaris] p. 40, or
       Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF
       p. 65) at ~ http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~~jlh/primer/hirst.pdf .

       In informal proofs, the statement "Let C be an element such that..."
       almost always means an implicit application of Rule C.

       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `
       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has
       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( ` C ` ) ` as a hypothesis for the
       proof where C is a new (ficticious) constant not appearing previously in
       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The
       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.

       We cannot do this in Metamath directly.  Instead, we use the original
       ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the
       proof.  We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the
       theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` .  Then we apply
       ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` .  Finally, we separately
       prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at
       the final theorem ` ps ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)  (Revised

  $( Extend wff definition to include proper substitution (read "the wff that
     results when ` y ` is properly substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` ").
     (Contributed by NM, 24-Jan-2006.) $)
  wsb $a wff [ y / x ] ph $.

  $( Define proper substitution.  Remark 9.1 in [Megill] p. 447 (p. 15 of the
     preprint).  For our notation, we use ` [ y / x ] ph ` to mean "the wff
     that results when ` y ` is properly substituted for ` x ` in the wff
     ` ph ` ."  We can also use ` [ y / x ] ph ` in place of the "free for"
     side condition used in traditional predicate calculus; see, for example,
     ~ stdpc4 .

     Our notation was introduced in Haskell B. Curry's _Foundations of
     Mathematical Logic_ (1977), p. 316 and is frequently used in textbooks of
     lambda calculus and combinatory logic.  This notation improves the common
     but ambiguous notation, " ` ph ( y ) ` is the wff that results when ` y `
     is properly substituted for ` x ` in ` ph ( x ) ` ."  For example, if the
     original ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = y ` , then ` ph ( y ) ` is ` y = y ` , from
     which we obtain that ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = x ` .  So what exactly does
     ` ph ( x ) ` mean?  Curry's notation solves this problem.

     In most books, proper substitution has a somewhat complicated recursive
     definition with multiple cases based on the occurrences of free and bound
     variables in the wff.  Instead, we use a single formula that is exactly
     equivalent and gives us a direct definition.  We later prove that our
     definition has the properties we expect of proper substitution (see
     theorems ~ sbequ , ~ sbcom2 and ~ sbid2v ).

     Note that our definition is valid even when ` x ` and ` y ` are replaced
     with the same variable, as ~ sbid shows.  We achieve this by having ` x `
     free in the first conjunct and bound in the second.  We can also achieve
     this by using a dummy variable, as the alternate definition ~ dfsb7 shows
     (which some logicians may prefer because it doesn't mix free and bound
     variables).  Another alternate definition which uses a dummy variable is
     ~ dfsb7a .

     When ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct, we can express proper substitution with
     the simpler expressions of ~ sb5 and ~ sb6 .

     In classical logic, we have additional equivalent definitions ~ dfsb2 and
     ~ dfsb3 , but we do not have intuitionistic proofs that those are
     equivalent.

     There are no restrictions on any of the variables, including what
     variables may occur in wff ` ph ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

       An open problem is whether this theorem can be proved without relying on
       ~ ax-16 or ~ ax-17 .

       Normally, ~ ax11o should be used rather than ~ ax-11o , except by
       theorems specifically studying the latter's properties.  (Contributed by

  $( Axiom ~ ax-11o ("o" for "old") was the original version of ~ ax-11 ,
     before it was discovered (in Jan. 2007) that the shorter ~ ax-11 could
     replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of
     the preprint).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of
     [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this
     theorem more easily, think of " ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ..." as informally
     meaning "if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then..."  The
     antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and
     ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some
     later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a
     "distinctor."

     This axiom is redundant, as shown by theorem ~ ax11o .

     This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above
     as theorem ~ ax11o .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)

       domains of discourse) and "protect" the consequent.

       with ` A. x A. z ` , conjoin them, and apply ~ dvelimdf .

                                 SET THEORY
###############################################################################

  Set theory uses the formalism of propositional and predicate calculus to
  assert properties of arbitrary mathematical objects called "sets."  A set can
  be contained in another set, and this relationship is indicated by the ` e. `
  symbol.  Starting with the simplest mathematical object, called the empty
  set, set theory builds up more and more complex structures whose existence
  follows from the axioms, eventually resulting in extremely complicated sets
  that we identify with the real numbers and other familiar mathematical
  objects.

  Here we develop set theory based on the Intuitionistic
  Zermelo-Fraenkel (IZF) system of [Crosilla] (Crosilla's Constructive
  Zermelo-Fraenkel (CZF) is not as easy to formalize in metamath
  because the Axiom of Restricted Separation would require us to
  develop the ability to classify formulas as bounded formulas, similar
  to the machinery we have built up for asserting on whether variables
  are free in formulas).

    $( Axiom of Extensionality.  It states that two sets are identical if they
       contain the same elements.  Axiom 1 of [Crosilla] (with unnnecessary
       quantifiers removed).

       Set theory can also be formulated with a _single_ primitive predicate
       ` e. ` on top of traditional predicate calculus _without_ equality.  In
       that case the Axiom of Extensionality becomes
       ` ( A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) -> ( x e. z -> y e. z ) ) ` , and
       equality ` x = y ` is _defined_ as ` A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) ` .  All
       of the usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory.
       See, for example, Axiom 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 8.

       To use the above "equality-free" version of Extensionality with
       Metamath's logical axioms, we would rewrite ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 with
       equality expanded according to the above definition.  Some of those
       axioms could be proved from set theory and would be redundant.  Not all
       of them are redundant, since our axioms of predicate calculus make
       essential use of equality for the proper substitution that is a
       primitive notion in traditional predicate calculus.  A study of such an
       axiomatization would be an interesting project for someone exploring the
       foundations of logic.

       It is important to understand that strictly speaking, all of our set
       theory axioms are really schemes that represent an infinite number of
       actual axioms.  This is inherent in the design of Metamath
       ("metavariable math"), which manipulates only metavariables.  For
       example, the metavariable ` x ` in ~ ax-ext can represent any actual
       variable _v1_, _v2_, _v3_,... .  Distinct variable restrictions ($d)
       prevent us from substituting say _v1_ for both ` x ` and ` z ` .  This
       is in contrast to typical textbook presentations that present actual
       axioms (except for axioms which involve wff metavariables).  In
       practice, though, the theorems and proofs are essentially the same.  The
       $d restrictions make each of the infinite axioms generated by the
       ~ ax-ext scheme exactly logically equivalent to each other and in
       particular to the actual axiom of the textbook version.  (Contributed by

  $( Define class abstraction notation (so-called by Quine), also called a
     "class builder" in the literature. ` x ` and ` y ` need not be distinct.
     Definition 2.1 of [Quine] p. 16.  Typically, ` ph ` will have ` y ` as a
     free variable, and " ` { y | ph } ` " is read "the class of all sets ` y `
     such that ` ph ( y ) ` is true."  We do not define ` { y | ph } ` in
     isolation but only as part of an expression that extends or "overloads"
     the ` e. ` relationship.

     This is our first use of the ` e. ` symbol to connect classes instead of
     sets.  The syntax definition ~ wcel , which extends or "overloads" the
     ~ wel definition connecting set variables, requires that both sides of
     ` e. ` be a class.  In ~ df-cleq and ~ df-clel , we introduce a new kind
     of variable (class variable) that can substituted with expressions such as
     ` { y | ph } ` .  In the present definition, the ` x ` on the left-hand
     side is a set variable.  Syntax definition ~ cv allows us to substitute a
     set variable ` x ` for a class variable: all sets are classes by ~ cvjust
     (but not necessarily vice-versa).  For a full description of how classes
     are introduced and how to recover the primitive language, see the
     discussion in Quine (and under ~ abeq2 for a quick overview).

     Because class variables can be substituted with compound expressions and
     set variables cannot, it is often useful to convert a theorem containing a
     free set variable to a more general version with a class variable.

     This is called the "axiom of class comprehension" by [Levy] p. 338, who
     treats the theory of classes as an extralogical extension to our logic and
     set theory axioms.  He calls the construction ` { y | ph } ` a "class
     term".

       [Quine] p. 18.  Also Definition 4.5 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13; Chapter 4
       provides its justification and methods for eliminating it.  Note that
       its elimination will not necessarily result in a single wff in the
       original language but possibly a "scheme" of wffs.

       This is an example of a somewhat "risky" definition, meaning that it has
       a more complex than usual soundness justification (outside of Metamath),
       because it "overloads" or reuses the existing equality symbol rather
       than introducing a new symbol.  This allows us to make statements that
       may not hold for the original symbol.  For example, it permits us to
       deduce ` y = z <-> A. x ( x e. y <-> x e. z ) ` , which is not a theorem
       of logic but rather presupposes the Axiom of Extensionality (see theorem
       ~ axext4 ).  We therefore include this axiom as a hypothesis, so that
       the use of Extensionality is properly indicated.

       We could avoid this complication by introducing a new symbol, say =_2,
       in place of ` = ` .  This would also have the advantage of making
       elimination of the definition straightforward, so that we could
       eliminate Extensionality as a hypothesis.  We would then also have the
       advantage of being able to identify in various proofs exactly where
       Extensionality truly comes into play rather than just being an artifact
       of a definition.  One of our theorems would then be ` x ` =_2
       ` y <-> x = y ` by invoking Extensionality.

       However, to conform to literature usage, we retain this overloaded
       definition.  This also makes some proofs shorter and probably easier to
       read, without the constant switching between two kinds of equality.

       See also comments under ~ df-clab , ~ df-clel , and ~ abeq2 .

       rigorous justification, because ~ cv is used as part of the proof of
       this theorem, but a careful argument can be made outside of the
       formalism of Metamath, for example as is done in Chapter 4 of Takeuti
       and Zaring.  See also the discussion under the definition of class in
       [Jech] p. 4 showing that "Every set can be considered to be a class."

       adopt as a definition.  See these references for its metalogical
       justification.  Note that like ~ df-cleq it extends or "overloads" the
       use of the existing membership symbol, but unlike ~ df-cleq it does not
       strengthen the set of valid wffs of logic when the class variables are
       replaced with set variables (see ~ cleljust ), so we don't include any
       set theory axiom as a hypothesis.  See also comments about the syntax
       under ~ df-clab .

       This is called the "axiom of membership" by [Levy] p. 338, who treats
       the theory of classes as an extralogical extension to our logic and set
       theory axioms.

    $( Equality of a class variable and a class abstraction (also called a
       class builder).  Theorem 5.1 of [Quine] p. 34.  This theorem shows the
       relationship between expressions with class abstractions and expressions
       with class variables.  Note that ~ abbi and its relatives are among
       those useful for converting theorems with class variables to equivalent
       theorems with wff variables, by first substituting a class abstraction
       for each class variable.

       Class variables can always be eliminated from a theorem to result in an
       equivalent theorem with wff variables, and vice-versa.  The idea is
       roughly as follows.  To convert a theorem with a wff variable ` ph `
       (that has a free variable ` x ` ) to a theorem with a class variable
       ` A ` , we substitute ` x e. A ` for ` ph ` throughout and simplify,
       where ` A ` is a new class variable not already in the wff.  Conversely,

                    Conditional equality (experimental)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This is a very useless definition, which "abbreviates" ` ( x = y -> ph ) ` as
  ` CondEq ( x = y -> ph ) ` . What this display hides, though, is that the
  first expression, even though it has a shorter constant string, is actually
  much more complicated in its parse tree: it is parsed as
  (wi (wceq (cv vx) (cv vy)) wph), while the ` CondEq ` version is parsed as
  (wcdeq vx vy wph).  It also allows us to give a name to the specific 3-ary
  operation ` ( x = y -> ph ) ` .

  This is all used as part of a metatheorem: we want to say that
  ` |- ( x = y -> ( ph ( x ) <-> ph ( y ) ) ) ` and
  ` |- ( x = y -> A ( x ) = A ( y ) ) ` are provable, for any expressions
  ` ph ( x ) ` or ` A ( x ) ` in the language.  The proof is by induction, so
  the base case is each of the primitives, which is why you will see a theorem
  for each of the set.mm primitive operations.

  The metatheorem comes with a disjoint variables assumption: every variable in
  ` ph ( x ) ` is assumed disjoint from ` x ` except ` x ` itself.  For such a
  proof by induction, we must consider each of the possible forms of
  ` ph ( x ) ` .  If it is a variable other than ` x ` , then we have
  ` CondEq ( x = y -> A = A ) ` or ` CondEq ( x = y -> ( ph <-> ph ) ) ` ,
  which is provable by ~ cdeqth and reflexivity.  Since we are only working
  with class and wff expressions, it can't be ` x ` itself in set.mm, but if it
  was we'd have to also prove ` CondEq ( x = y -> x = y ) ` (where _set_
  equality is being used on the right).

  Otherwise, it is a primitive operation applied to smaller expressions.  In
  these cases, for each set variable parameter to the operation, we must
  consider if it is equal to ` x ` or not, which yields 2^n proof obligations.
  Luckily, all primitive operations in set.mm have either zero or one set
  variable, so we only need to prove one statement for the non-set constructors
  (like implication) and two for the constructors taking a set (the forall and
  the class builder).

  In each of the primitive proofs, we are allowed to assume that ` y ` is
  disjoint from ` ph ( x ) ` and vice versa, because this is maintained through
  the induction.  This is how we satisfy the DV assumptions of ~ cdeqab1 and
  ~ cdeqab .

    $( Russell's Paradox.  Proposition 4.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14.

       In the late 1800s, Frege's Axiom of (unrestricted) Comprehension,
       expressed in our notation as ` A e. _V ` , asserted that any collection
       of sets ` A ` is a set i.e. belongs to the universe ` _V ` of all sets.
       In particular, by substituting ` { x | x e/ x } ` (the "Russell class")
       for ` A ` , it asserted ` { x | x e/ x } e. _V ` , meaning that the
       "collection of all sets which are not members of themselves" is a set.
       However, here we prove ` { x | x e/ x } e/ _V ` .  This contradiction
       was discovered by Russell in 1901 (published in 1903), invalidating the
       Comprehension Axiom and leading to the collapse of Frege's system.

       In 1908, Zermelo rectified this fatal flaw by replacing Comprehension
       with a weaker Subset (or Separation) Axiom asserting that ` A ` is a set
       only when it is smaller than some other set ` B ` .  The intuitionistic
       set theory IZF includes such a separation axiom, Axiom 6 of [Crosilla]
       p.  "Axioms of CZF and IZF".  (Contributed by NM, 7-Aug-1994.) $)

  $( Define the proper substitution of a class for a set.

     When ` A ` is a proper class, our definition evaluates to false.  This is
     somewhat arbitrary: we could have, instead, chosen the conclusion of
     ~ sbc6 for our definition, which always evaluates to true for proper
     classes.

     Our definition also does not produce the same results as discussed in the
     proof of Theorem 6.6 of [Quine] p. 42 (although Theorem 6.6 itself does
     hold, as shown by ~ dfsbcq below).  Unfortunately, Quine's definition
     requires a recursive syntactical breakdown of ` ph ` , and it does not
     seem possible to express it with a single closed formula.

     If we did not want to commit to any specific proper class behavior, we
     could use this definition _only_ to prove theorem ~ dfsbcq , which holds
     for both our definition and Quine's, and from which we can derive a weaker
     version of ~ df-sbc in the form of ~ sbc8g .  However, the behavior of
     Quine's definition at proper classes is similarly arbitrary, and for
     practical reasons (to avoid having to prove sethood of ` A ` in every use
     of this definition) we allow direct reference to ~ df-sbc and assert that
     ` [. A / x ]. ph ` is always false when ` A ` is a proper class.

     The related definition df-csb defines proper substitution into a class
     variable (as opposed to a wff variable).  (Contributed by NM,

  $( This theorem, which is similar to Theorem 6.7 of [Quine] p. 42 and holds
     under both our definition and Quine's, provides us with a weak definition
     of the proper substitution of a class for a set.  Since our ~ df-sbc does
     not result in the same behavior as Quine's for proper classes, if we
     wished to avoid conflict with Quine's definition we could start with this
     theorem and ~ dfsbcq2 instead of ~ df-sbc .  ( ~ dfsbcq2 is needed because
     unlike Quine we do not overload the ~ df-sb syntax.)  As a consequence of
     these theorems, we can derive ~ sbc8g , which is a weaker version of
     ~ df-sbc that leaves substitution undefined when ` A ` is a proper class.

     However, it is often a nuisance to have to prove the sethood hypothesis of
     ~ sbc8g , so we will allow direct use of ~ df-sbc .  Proper substiution
     with a proper class is rarely needed, and when it is, we can simply use
     the expansion of Quine's definition.  (Contributed by NM, 14-Apr-1995.) $)

###############################################################################

   There are a variety of theorems that only hold for decidable propositions,
   for example ~ df-dc , ~ notnotdc , or ~ condc , and we have stated and
   proved them for decidable propositions.

   As a historical note, however, the Intuitionistic Logic Explorer originated
   as a fork of the non-intuitionistic Metamath Proof Explorer, and the
   project of adding decidability conditions everywhere they are needed (or
   replacing non-intuitionistic proofs entirely) is not yet complete.

   Therefore, this section also (for now) contains the non-intuitionistic
   ~ ax-3 and additional theorems which rely on ~ ax-3 . As we replace
   classical proofs with intuitionistic ones, remove classical proofs which
   are unused and not especially important to contrast classical and
   intuitionistic results, or add decidability conditions to make proofs not
   rely on ~ ax-3 , we plan on reducing use of ~ ax-3 , moving ~ ax-3 still
   later in the file, and eventually removing it entirely.

  $( Axiom _Transp_.  Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49.

     Unconditional form of ~ condc .  We state this as an axiom for the benefit
     of theorems which have not yet been converted over to having appropriate
     decidability conditions added.  We could also transform intuitionistic
     logic to classical logic by adding unconditional forms of ~ exmiddc ,
     ~ peircedc , or ~ notnot2dc .

     This axiom swaps or "transposes" the order of the consequents when
     negation is removed.  An informal example is that the statement "if there
     are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies the statement "if it
     is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This axiom is called _Transp_
     or "the principle of transposition" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem
     *2.17 of [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103).  We will also use the term
     "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader is advised that
     in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has a different
     technical meaning.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)
