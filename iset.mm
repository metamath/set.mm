                                1. Naming
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Theorems which are the same as in set.mm should be named the same (that is,
where the statement of the theorem is the same; the proof can differ without
a new name being called for).  Theorems which are different should be named
differently.  A biconditional in set.mm which is an implication in iset.mm
should have a "r" (for the reverse direction), or "i"/"im" (for the forward
direction) appended.  A theorem in set.mm which has a decidability condition
added should add "dc" to the theorem name.  A theorem in set.mm where
"nonempty class" is changed to "inhabited class" should add "m" (for member)
to the theorem name.

As with set.mm, we welcome suggestions for better names (such as names which
are more consistent with naming conventions).

                      4. Metamath syntax summary
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The HELP LANGUAGE command in the Metamath program will give you a quick
overview of Metamath.  Syntax summary:

          $c ... $. - Constant declaration
          $v ... $. - Variable declaration
          $d ... $. - Disjoint (distinct) variable restriction
  <label> $f ... $. - "Floating" hypothesis (i.e. variable type declaration)
  <label> $e ... $. - "Essential" hypothesis (i.e. a logical assumption for a
                      theorem or axiom)
  <label> $a ... $. - Axiom or definition or syntax construction
  <label> $p ... $= ... $. - Theorem and its proof
          ${ ... $} - Block for defining the scope of the above statements
                      (except $a, $p which are forever active)
$)        $( ... $)
$(                  - Comments (may not be nested); see HELP LANGUAGE
                      for markup features
          $[ ... $] - Include a file

The above two-character sequences beginning with "$" are the only primitives
built into the Metamath language.  The only "logic" Metamath uses in its proof
verification algorithm is the substitution of expressions for variables while
checking for distinct variable violations.  Everything else, including the
axioms for logic, is defined in this database file.

Here is some more detail about the syntax.  There are two kinds of user-defined
syntax elements, called math symbols (or just symbols) and labels.  A symbol
may contain any non-whitespace printable character except "$".  A label may
contain only alphanumeric characters and the characters "."  (period), "-"
(hyphen), and "_" (underscore).  Tokens and labels are case-sensitive.  All
labels (except in proofs) must be distinct.  A label may not have the same name
as a token (to simplify the coding of certain parsers and translators).

  $c <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols that
      haven't been used before.
  $v <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of distinct symbols that haven't been used yet
      in the current scope (see ${ ... $} below).
  $d <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a (whitespace-separated) list of distinct symbols
      previously declared with $v in current scope.  It means that
      substitutions into these symbols may not have variables in common.
  <label> $f <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $e <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $a <symbollist> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.
  <label> $p <symbollist> $= <proof> $.
      <symbollist> is a list of 2 or more symbols, the first of which must be
      previously declared with $c in the current scope.  <proof> is either a
      whitespace-delimited sequence of previous labels (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /NORMAL) or a compressed proof (created by
      SAVE PROOF <label> /COMPRESSED).  After using SAVE PROOF, use
      WRITE SOURCE to save the database file to disk.
  ${ ... $}
      Block for scoping the above statements (except $a, $p which are forever
      active).  Currently, $c may not occur inside of a block.
$)
  $( <any text> $)
$(    Comment.  Note: <any text> may not contain adjacent "$" and ")"
      characters.
  $[ <filename> $]
      Insert contents of <filename> at this point.  If <filename> is current
      file or has been already been inserted, it will not be inserted again.

Inside of comments, it is recommended that labels be preceded with a tilde (~)
and math symbol tokens be enclosed in grave accents (` `).  This way the LaTeX
and HTML rendition of comments will be accurate, and (future) tools to globally
change labels and math symbols will also change them in comments.  Note that ``
inside of grave accents is interpreted as a single ` .  A special comment
containing $ t defines LaTeX and HTML symbols.  See HELP LANGUAGE and
HELP HTML for other markup features in comments.

The proofs in this file are in "compressed" format for storage efficiency.  The
Metamath program reads the compressed format directly.  This format is
described in an Appendix of the Metamath book.  It is not intended to be read
by humans.  For viewing proofs you should use the various SHOW PROOF commands
described in the Metamath book (or the on-line HELP).

The Metamath program does not normally affect any content of this file (set.mm)
other than proofs, i.e. tokens between "$=" and "$.".  All other content is
user-created.  Proofs are created or modified with the PROVE command.

                          5. Other notes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

1. It is recommended that you be familiar with chapters 2 and 4 of the
'Metamath' book to understand the Metamath language.  Chapters 2, 3 and 5
explain how to use the program.  Chapter 3 gives you an informal overview of
what this source file is all about.  Appendix A shows you the standard
mathematical symbols corresponding to some of the ASCII tokens in this file.

The ASCII tokens may seem cryptic at first, even if you are familiar with set
theory, but a review of the definition summary in Chapter 3 should quickly
enable you to see the correspondence to standard mathematical notation.  To
easily find the definition of a token, search for the first occurrences of the
token surrounded by spaces.  Some odd-looking ones include "-." for "not", and
"C_" for "is a subset of."  (HELP TEX tells you how to obtain a LaTeX output to
see the real mathematical symbols.)  Let me know if you have better suggestions
for naming ASCII tokens.

2. Logic and set theory provide a foundation for all of mathematics.  To learn
about them, you should study one or more of the references listed below.  The
textbooks provide a motivation for what we are doing, whereas Metamath lets you
see in detail all hidden and implicit steps.  Most standard theorems are
accompanied by citations.  Some closely followed texts include the following:

  Axioms of propositional calculus - [Margaris].
  Axioms of predicate calculus - [Megill] (System S3' in the article
      referenced).
  Theorems of propositional calculus - [WhiteheadRussell].
  Theorems of pure predicate calculus - [Margaris].
  Theorems of equality and substitution - [Monk2], [Tarski], [Megill].
  Axioms of set theory - [BellMachover].
  Development of set theory - [TakeutiZaring].  (The first part of [Quine]
      has a good explanation of the powerful device of "virtual" or
      class abstractions, which is essential to our development.)
  Construction of real and complex numbers - [Gleason]
  Theorems about real numbers - [Apostol]
  Intuitionistic logic and constructive mathematics - [Bauer] is an sampling
    of theorems and arguments which give a flavor of constructive mathematics.
    [Heyting] is a more comprehensive treatment of intuitionistic logic.

3. Convention:  All $a statements starting with "|-" have labels
starting with "ax-" (axioms) or "df-" (definitions).  "ax-" corresponds
to what is traditionally called an axiom.  "df-" introduces new symbols
or a new relationship among symbols that can be eliminated; they always
extend the definition of a wff or class.  Metamath blindly treats $a
statements as new given facts but does not try to justify them.  The
mmj2 program will justify the definitions as sound, except for 5 (df-bi,
df-cleq, df-clel, df-clab, df-sbc) that require a more complex metalogical
justification by hand.

4. Our method of definition, the axioms for predicate calculus, and the
development of substitution are somewhat different from those found in standard
texts.  The axioms were designed for direct derivation of standard results
without excessive use of metatheorems.  (See Theorem 9.7 of [Megill] for a
rigorous justification.)  Typically we are minimalist when introducing new
definitions; they are introduced only when a clear advantage becomes apparent
for reducing the number of symbols, shortening proofs, etc.  We generally avoid
the introduction of gratuitous definitions because each one requires associated
theorems and additional elimination steps in proofs.

5. Where possible, the notation attempts to conform to modern conventions, with
variations due to our choice of the axiom system or to make proofs shorter.
Listed below are some important conventions and how they correspond to textbook
language.  The notation is usually explained in more detail when first
introduced.

  Typically, Greek letters (ph = phi, ps = psi, ch = chi, etc.) are used for
      propositional (wff) variables; x,y,z,... for individual (i.e. set)
      variables; and A,B,C,... for class variables.
  "|-", meaning "It is provable that," is the first token of all assertions
      and hypotheses that aren't syntax constructions.  This is a standard
      convention in logic.  For us, it also prevents any ambiguity with
      statements that are syntax constructions, such as "wff -. ph".
  "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." should be read "Assume variable x is
      (effectively) not free in wff phi."  Literally, this says "Assume it is
      provable that phi implies for all x phi."
  "|- ( -. A. x x = y -> ..." should be read "If x and y are distinct
      variables, then..."  This antecedent provides us with a technical
      device (called a "distinctor" in [Megill]) to avoid the need for the
      $d statement early in our development of predicate calculus, permitting
      unrestricted substitituions as conceptually simple as those in
      propositional calculus.  However, the $d eventually becomes a
      requirement, and after that this device is rarely used.
  "[ y / x ] ph" should be read "the wff that results when y is properly
      substituted for x in ph."
  "$d x y $." should be read "Assume x and y are distinct variables."
  "$d x ph $." should be read "Assume x does not occur in phi $."  Sometimes
      a theorem is proved with "$e |- ( ph -> A. x ph ) $." in place of
      "$d x ph $." when a more general result is desired; ~ ax-17 can be used
      to derive the $d version.  For an example of how to get from the $d
      version back to the $e version, see the proof of ~ euf from ~ df-eu .
  "$d x A $." should be read "Assume x is not a variable occurring in class A."
  "$d x A $.  $d x ps $.  $e |- ( x = A -> ( ph <-> ps ) ) $." is an idiom
      often used instead of explicit substitution, meaning "Assume psi results
      from the substitution of A for x in phi."
  "$e |- A e. _V $." should be read "Assume class A is a set (i.e. exists)."
      This is a convenient convention used by [Quine].
  "$d x y $.  $e |- y e. A -> A. x y e. A $." should be read "Assume x is
      (effectively) not a free variable in class A."
  "`' R" should be read "converse of (relation) R" and is the same as the more
      standard notation R^{-1}.
  "( f ` x )" should be read "the value of function f at x" and is the same as
      the more familiar f(x).
  The Deduction Theorem of standard logic is never used.  Instead, in set
      theory, we use other tricks to make a $e hypothesis become an antecedent.
      See the comment for theorem ~ dedth below.

           6. Acceptable shorter proofs
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Shorter proofs are welcome, and any shorter proof I accept will be acknowledged
in the theorem's description.  However, in some cases a proof may be "shorter"
or not depending on how it is formatted.  This section provides general
guidelines.

Usually I will automatically accept shorter proofs that (1) shorten the set.mm
file (with compressed proofs), (2) reduce the size of the HTML file generated
with SHOW STATEMENT xx / HTML, (3) use only existing, unmodified theorems in
the database (the order of theorems may be changed, though), and (4) use no
additional axioms.

Usually I will also automatically accept a _new_ theorem that is used to
shorten multiple proofs, if the total size of set.mm (including the comment of
the new theorem, not including the acknowledgment) decreases as a result.

In borderline cases, I typically place more importance on the number of
compressed proof steps and less on the length of the label section (since the
names are in principal arbitrary).  If two proofs have the same number of
compressed proof steps, I will typically give preference to the one with the
smaller number of different labels, or if these numbers are the same, the proof
with the fewest number of characters that the proofs happen to have by chance
when label lengths are included.

A few theorems have a longer proof than necessary in order to avoid the use of
certain axioms, for pedagogical purposes, and for other reasons.  Usually this
is clear from the theorem's description.  For example, id1 shows a proof
directly from axioms.  Shorter proofs for such cases won't be accepted, of
course, unless the criteria described continues to be satisfied.

    $( (_Note_:  This inference rule and the next one, ~ idi , will normally
       never appear in a completed proof.  It can be ignored if you are using
       this database to assist learning logic - please start with the statement
       ~ wn instead.)

       This is a technical inference to assist proof development.  It provides
       a temporary way to add an independent subproof to a proof under
       development, for later assignment to a normal proof step.

       The metamath program's Proof Assistant requires proofs to be developed
       backwards from the conclusion with no gaps, and it has no mechanism that
       lets the user to work on isolated subproofs.  This inference provides a
       workaround for this limitation.  It can be inserted at any point in a
       proof to allow an independent subproof to be developed on the side, for
       later use as part of the final proof.

       _Instructions_:  (1) Assign this inference to any unknown step in the
       proof.  Typically, the last unknown step is the most convenient, since
       'assign last' can be used.  This step will be replicated in hypothesis
       dummylink.1, from where the development of the main proof can continue.
       (2) Develop the independent subproof backwards from hypothesis
       dummylink.2.  If desired, use a 'let' command to pre-assign the
       conclusion of the independent subproof to dummylink.2.  (3) After the
       independent subproof is complete, use 'improve all' to assign it
       automatically to an unknown step in the main proof that matches it.  (4)
       After the entire proof is complete, use 'minimize *' to clean up
       (discard) all dummylink references automatically.

       This inference was originally designed to assist importing partially
       completed Proof Worksheets from the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI, but it can
       also be useful on its own.  Interestingly, no axioms are required for
       its proof.  (Contributed by NM, 7-Feb-2006.) $)

   The results in this section are based on implication only, and only use
   ~ ax-1 , ~ ax-2 , and ~ ax-mp .
   In an implication, the wff before the arrow is called the "antecedent" and
   the wff after the arrow is called the "consequent."

   We will use the following descriptive terms very loosely:  A "closed form"
   or "tautology" has no $e hypotheses.  An "inference" has one or more $e
   hypotheses.  A "deduction" is an inference in which the hypotheses and the
   conclusion share the same antecedent.

       _Naming convention_:  We often call a theorem a "deduction" and suffix
       its label with "d" whenever the hypotheses and conclusion are each
       prefixed with the same antecedent.  This allows us to use the theorem in
       places where (in traditional textbook formalizations) the standard
       Deduction Theorem would be used; here ` ph ` would be replaced with a
       conjunction ( ~ wa ) of the hypotheses of the would-be deduction.  By
       contrast, we tend to call the simpler version with no common antecedent
       an "inference" and suffix its label with "i"; compare theorem ~ a1i .
       Finally, a "theorem" would be the form with no hypotheses; in this case
       the "theorem" form would be the original axiom ~ ax-1 .  We usually show
       the theorem form without a suffix on its label (e.g. ~ pm2.43 vs.

  $( This is our first definition, which introduces and defines the
     biconditional connective ` <-> ` .  We define a wff of the form
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` as an abbreviation for
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` .

     Unlike most traditional developments, we have chosen not to have a
     separate symbol such as "Df." to mean "is defined as."  Instead, we will
     later use the biconditional connective for this purpose, as it allows us
     to use logic to manipulate definitions directly.  For an example of such a
     definition, see ~ df-3or .  This greatly simplifies many proofs since it
     eliminates the need for a separate mechanism for introducing and
     eliminating definitions.  Of course, we cannot use this mechanism to
     define the biconditional itself, since it hasn't been introduced yet.
     Instead, we use a more general form of definition, described as follows.

     In its most general form, a definition is simply an assertion that
     introduces a new symbol (or a new combination of existing symbols, as in
     ~ df-3an ) that is eliminable and does not strengthen the existing
     language.  The latter requirement means that the set of provable
     statements not containing the new symbol (or new combination) should
     remain exactly the same after the definition is introduced.  Our
     definition of the biconditional may look unusual compared to most
     definitions, but it strictly satisfies these requirements.

     The justification for our definition is that if we mechanically replace
     ` ( ph <-> ps ) ` (the definiendum i.e. the thing being defined) with
     ` ( ( ph -> ps ) /\ ( ps -> ph ) ) ` (the definiens i.e. the defining
     expression) in the definition, the definition becomes the previously
     proved theorem ~ biijust .  It is impossible to use ~ df-bi to prove any
     statement expressed in the original language that can't be proved from the
     original axioms, because if we simply replace each instance of ~ df-bi in
     the proof with the corresponding ~ biijust instance, we will end up with a
     proof from the original axioms.

     Note that from Metamath's point of view, a definition is just another
     axiom - i.e. an assertion we claim to be true - but from our high level
     point of view, we are are not strengthening the language.  To indicate
     this fact, we prefix definition labels with "df-" instead of "ax-".  (This
     prefixing is an informal convention that means nothing to the Metamath
     proof verifier; it is just for human readability.)

     ~ df-bi itself is a conjunction of two implications (to avoid using the
     biconditional in its own definition), but once we have the biconditional,
     we can prove ~ dfbi2 which uses the biconditional instead.

     Other definitions of the biconditional, such as ~ dfbi3dc , only hold for
     decidable propositions, not all propositions.  (Contributed by NM,

   classical (non-inuitionistic) logic, for all propositions. Other theorems
   only hold for decidable propositions, such as the law of the excluded
   middle ( ~ df-dc ), double negation elimination ( ~ notnotdc ), or

  $( Contraposition of a decidable proposition.

     This theorem swaps or "transposes" the order of the consequents when
     negation is removed.  An informal example is that the statement "if there
     are no clouds in the sky, it is not raining" implies the statement "if it
     is raining, there are clouds in the sky."  This theorem (without the
     decidability condition, of course) is called _Transp_ or "the principle of
     transposition" in _Principia Mathematica_ (Theorem *2.17 of
     [WhiteheadRussell] p. 103) and is Axiom A3 of [Margaris] p. 49.  We will
     also use the term "contraposition" for this principle, although the reader
     is advised that in the field of philosophical logic, "contraposition" has
     a different technical meaning.

        Truth tables: Operations on true and false constants
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  For classical logic, truth tables can be used to define propositional
  logic operations, by showing the results of those operations for all
  possible combinations of true ( ` T. ` ) and false ( ` F. ` ).

  Although the intuitionistic logic connectives are not as simply defined,
  ` T. ` and ` F. ` do play similar roles as in classical logic and most
  theorems from classical logic continue to hold.

  Here we show that our definitions and axioms produce equivalent results for
  ` T. ` and ` F. ` as we would get from truth tables for
  ` /\ ` (conjunction aka logical 'and') ~ wa ,
  ` \/ ` (disjunction aka logical inclusive 'or') ~ wo ,
  ` -> ` (implies) ~ wi ,
  ` -. ` (not) ~ wn ,
  ` <-> ` (logical equivalence) ~ df-bi , and
  ` \/_ ` (exclusive or) ~ df-xor .

                Stoic logic indemonstrables (Chrysippus of Soli)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  The Greek Stoics developed a system of logic.
  The Stoic Chrysippus, in particular, was often considered one of the greatest
  logicians of antiquity.
  Stoic logic is different from Aristotle's system, since it focuses
  on propositional logic,
  though later thinkers did combine the systems of the Stoics with Aristotle.
  Jan Lukasiewicz reports,
  "For anybody familiar with mathematical logic it is self-evident
  that the Stoic dialectic is the ancient form of modern propositional logic"
  ( _On the history of the logic of proposition_ by Jan Lukasiewicz (1934),
  translated in: _Selected Works_ - Edited by Ludwik Borkowski -
  Amsterdam, North-Holland, 1970 pp. 197-217,
  referenced in "History of Logic"
  ~ https://www.historyoflogic.com/logic-stoics.htm ).
  For more about Aristotle's system, see barbara and related theorems.

  A key part of the Stoic logic system is a set of five "indemonstrables"
  assigned to Chrysippus of Soli by Diogenes Laertius, though in
  general it is difficult to assign specific
  ideas to specific thinkers.
  The indemonstrables are described in, for example,
  [Lopez-Astorga] p. 11 , [Sanford] p. 39, and [Hitchcock] p. 5.
  These indemonstrables are
  modus ponendo ponens (modus ponens) ~ ax-mp ,
  modus tollendo tollens (modus tollens) ~ mto ,
  modus ponendo tollens I ~ mpto1 ,
  modus ponendo tollens II ~ mpto2 , and
  modus tollendo ponens (exclusive-or version) ~ mtp-xor .
  The first is an axiom, the second is already proved; in this section
  we prove the other three.
  Since we assume or prove all of indemonstrables, the system of logic we use
  here is as at least as strong as the set of Stoic indemonstrables.
  Note that modus tollendo ponens ~ mtp-xor originally used exclusive-or,
  but over time the name modus tollendo ponens has increasingly referred
  to an inclusive-or variation, which is proved in ~ mtp-or .
  This set of indemonstrables is not the entire system of Stoic logic.

       ~ mpto2 ) as a "safer, and these days much more common" version of modus
       ponendo tollens because it avoids confusion between inclusive-or and
       exclusive-or.  (Contributed by David A. Wheeler, 2-Mar-2018.) $)

  $( Define the not-free predicate for wffs.  This is read " ` x ` is not free
     in ` ph ` ".  Not-free means that the value of ` x ` cannot affect the
     value of ` ph ` , e.g., any occurrence of ` x ` in ` ph ` is effectively
     bound by a "for all" or something that expands to one (such as "there
     exists").  In particular, substitution for a variable not free in a wff
     does not affect its value ( ~ sbf ).  An example of where this is used is
     ~ stdpc5 .  See ~ nf2 for an alternative definition which does not involve
     nested quantifiers on the same variable.

     Not-free is a commonly used constraint, so it is useful to have a notation
     for it.  Surprisingly, there is no common formal notation for it, so here
     we devise one.  Our definition lets us work with the not-free notion
     within the logic itself rather than as a metalogical side condition.

     To be precise, our definition really means "effectively not free," because
     it is slightly less restrictive than the usual textbook definition for
     not-free (which only considers syntactic freedom).  For example, ` x ` is
     effectively not free in the bare expression ` x = x ` , even though ` x `
     would be considered free in the usual textbook definition, because the
     value of ` x ` in the expression ` x = x ` cannot affect the truth of the
     expression (and thus substitution will not change the result).

     except ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 are still valid even when ` x ` , ` y ` , and
     ` z ` are replaced with the same variable because they do not have any
     distinct variable (Metamath's $d) restrictions.  Distinct variable
     restrictions are required for ~ ax-16 and ~ ax-17 only.  (Contributed by

     The original version of this axiom was ~ ax-10o ("o" for "old") and was
     replaced with this shorter ~ ax-10 in May 2008.  The old axiom is proved
     from this one as theorem ~ ax10o .  Conversely, this axiom is proved from

     is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of [Monk2] p. 105,
     from which it can be proved by cases.

     Variants of this axiom which are equivalent in classical logic but which
     have not been shown to be equivalent for intuitionistic logic are
     ~ ax11v , ~ ax11v2 and ~ ax-11o .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

  $( Axiom of Quantifier Introduction.  One of the equality and substitution
     axioms of predicate calculus with equality.  Informally, it says that
     whenever ` z ` is distinct from ` x ` and ` y ` , and ` x = y ` is true,
     then ` x = y ` quantified with ` z ` is also true.  In other words, ` z `
     is irrelevant to the truth of ` x = y ` .  Axiom scheme C9' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  It apparently does not otherwise appear
     in the literature but is easily proved from textbook predicate calculus by
     cases.

     This axiom has been modified from the original ~ ax-12 for compatibility
     with intuitionistic logic.  (Contributed by Mario Carneiro,
     31-Jan-2015.) $)

  $( Axiom of bundling.  The general idea of this axiom is that two variables
     are either distinct or non-distinct.  That idea could be expressed as
     ` A. z z = x \/ -. A. z z = x ` .  However, we instead choose an axiom
     which has many of the same consequences, but which is different with
     respect to a universe which contains only one object. ` A. z z = x ` holds
     if ` z ` and ` x ` are the same variable, likewise for ` z ` and ` y ` ,
     and ` A. x A. z ( x = y -> A. z x = y ) ` holds if ` z ` is distinct from
     the others (and the universe has at least two objects).

     As with other statements of the form "x is decidable (either true or
     false)", this does not entail the full Law of the Excluded Middle (which
     is the proposition that all statements are decidable), but instead merely
     the assertion that particular kinds of statements are decidable (or in
     this case, an assertion similar to decidability).

     This axiom implies ~ ax-i12 as can be seen at ~ axi12 .  Whether ax-bnd
     can be proved from the remaining axioms including ~ ax-i12 is not known.

     The reason we call this "bundling" is that a statement without a distinct
     variable constraint "bundles" together two statements, one in which the
     two variables are the same and one in which they are different.

  $( Axiom of Specialization.  A quantified wff implies the wff without a
     quantifier (i.e. an instance, or special case, of the generalized wff).
     In other words if something is true for all ` x ` , it is true for any
     specific ` x ` (that would typically occur as a free variable in the wff
     substituted for ` ph ` ).  (A free variable is one that does not occur in
     the scope of a quantifier: ` x ` and ` y ` are both free in ` x = y ` ,
     but only ` x ` is free in ` A. y x = y ` .)  Axiom scheme C5' in [Megill]
     p. 448 (p. 16 of the preprint).  Also appears as Axiom B5 of [Tarski]
     p. 67 (under his system S2, defined in the last paragraph on p. 77).

     Note that the converse of this axiom does not hold in general, but a
     weaker inference form of the converse holds and is expressed as rule
     ~ ax-gen .  Conditional forms of the converse are given by ~ ax-12 ,
     ~ ax-16 , and ~ ax-17 .

     Unlike the more general textbook Axiom of Specialization, we cannot choose
     a variable different from ` x ` for the special case.  For use, that
     requires the assistance of equality axioms, and we deal with it later

       This inference, along with our many variants is used to implement a
       metatheorem called "Rule C" that is given in many logic textbooks.  See,
       for example, Rule C in [Mendelson] p. 81, Rule C in [Margaris] p. 40, or
       Rule C in Hirst and Hirst's _A Primer for Logic and Proof_ p. 59 (PDF
       p. 65) at ~ http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/~~jlh/primer/hirst.pdf .

       In informal proofs, the statement "Let C be an element such that..."
       almost always means an implicit application of Rule C.

       In essence, Rule C states that if we can prove that some element ` x `
       exists satisfying a wff, i.e. ` E. x ph ( x ) ` where ` ph ( x ) ` has
       ` x ` free, then we can use ` ph ( ` C ` ) ` as a hypothesis for the
       proof where C is a new (ficticious) constant not appearing previously in
       the proof, nor in any axioms used, nor in the theorem to be proved.  The
       purpose of Rule C is to get rid of the existential quantifier.

       We cannot do this in Metamath directly.  Instead, we use the original
       ` ph ` (containing ` x ` ) as an antecedent for the main part of the
       proof.  We eventually arrive at ` ( ph -> ps ) ` where ` ps ` is the
       theorem to be proved and does not contain ` x ` .  Then we apply
       ~ exlimiv to arrive at ` ( E. x ph -> ps ) ` .  Finally, we separately
       prove ` E. x ph ` and detach it with modus ponens ~ ax-mp to arrive at
       the final theorem ` ps ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)  (Revised

     results when ` y ` is properly substituted for ` x ` in wff ` ph ` ").
     (Contributed by NM, 24-Jan-2006.) $)
  wsb $a wff [ y / x ] ph $.

  $( Define proper substitution.  Remark 9.1 in [Megill] p. 447 (p. 15 of the
     preprint).  For our notation, we use ` [ y / x ] ph ` to mean "the wff
     that results when ` y ` is properly substituted for ` x ` in the wff
     ` ph ` ."  We can also use ` [ y / x ] ph ` in place of the "free for"
     side condition used in traditional predicate calculus; see, for example,
     ~ stdpc4 .

     Our notation was introduced in Haskell B. Curry's _Foundations of
     Mathematical Logic_ (1977), p. 316 and is frequently used in textbooks of
     lambda calculus and combinatory logic.  This notation improves the common
     but ambiguous notation, " ` ph ( y ) ` is the wff that results when ` y `
     is properly substituted for ` x ` in ` ph ( x ) ` ."  For example, if the
     original ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = y ` , then ` ph ( y ) ` is ` y = y ` , from
     which we obtain that ` ph ( x ) ` is ` x = x ` .  So what exactly does
     ` ph ( x ) ` mean?  Curry's notation solves this problem.

     In most books, proper substitution has a somewhat complicated recursive
     definition with multiple cases based on the occurrences of free and bound
     variables in the wff.  Instead, we use a single formula that is exactly
     equivalent and gives us a direct definition.  We later prove that our
     definition has the properties we expect of proper substitution (see
     theorems ~ sbequ , ~ sbcom2 and ~ sbid2v ).

     Note that our definition is valid even when ` x ` and ` y ` are replaced
     with the same variable, as ~ sbid shows.  We achieve this by having ` x `
     free in the first conjunct and bound in the second.  We can also achieve
     this by using a dummy variable, as the alternate definition ~ dfsb7 shows
     (which some logicians may prefer because it doesn't mix free and bound
     variables).  Another alternate definition which uses a dummy variable is
     ~ dfsb7a .

     When ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct, we can express proper substitution with
     the simpler expressions of ~ sb5 and ~ sb6 .

     In classical logic, another possible definition is
     ` ( x = y /\ ph ) \/ A. x ( x = y -> ph ) ` but we do not have an
     intuitionistic proof that this is equivalent.

     There are no restrictions on any of the variables, including what
     variables may occur in wff ` ph ` .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

       Normally, ~ ax11o should be used rather than ~ ax-11o , except by

  $( Axiom ~ ax-11o ("o" for "old") was the original version of ~ ax-11 ,
     before it was discovered (in Jan. 2007) that the shorter ~ ax-11 could
     replace it.  It appears as Axiom scheme C15' in [Megill] p. 448 (p. 16 of
     the preprint).  It is based on Lemma 16 of [Tarski] p. 70 and Axiom C8 of
     [Monk2] p. 105, from which it can be proved by cases.  To understand this
     theorem more easily, think of " ` -. A. x x = y -> ` ..." as informally
     meaning "if ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct variables then..."  The
     antecedent becomes false if the same variable is substituted for ` x ` and
     ` y ` , ensuring the theorem is sound whenever this is the case.  In some
     later theorems, we call an antecedent of the form ` -. A. x x = y ` a
     "distinctor."

     This axiom is redundant, as shown by theorem ~ ax11o .

     This axiom is obsolete and should no longer be used.  It is proved above
     as theorem ~ ax11o .  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.)

               Aristotelian logic: Assertic syllogisms
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  Model the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms using modern notation.
  This section shows that the Aristotelian assertic syllogisms can be proven
  with our axioms of logic, and also provides generally useful theorems.

  In antiquity Aristotelian logic and Stoic logic
  (see ~ mpto1 ) were the leading logical systems.
  Aristotelian logic became the leading system in medieval Europe;
  this section models this system (including later refinements to it).
  Aristotle defined syllogisms very generally
  ("a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed,
  something different from the things supposed results of necessity
  because these things are so")
  Aristotle, _Prior Analytics_ 24b18-20.
  However, in _Prior Analytics_ he limits himself to
  categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions
  with specific structures.  The syllogisms are the valid subset of
  the possible combinations of these structures.
  The medieval schools used vowels to identify the types of terms
  (a=all, e=none, i=some, and o=some are not), and named the different
  syllogisms with Latin words that had the vowels in the intended order.

  "There is a surprising amount of scholarly debate
  about how best to formalize Aristotle's syllogisms..." according to
  _Aristotle's Modal Proofs: Prior Analytics A8-22 in Predicate Logic_,
  Adriane Rini, Springer, 2011, ISBN 978-94-007-0049-9, page 28.
  For example, Lukasiewicz believes it is important to note that
  "Aristotle does not introduce singular terms or premisses into his system".
  Lukasiewicz also believes that Aristotelian syllogisms are
  predicates (having a true/false value), not inference rules:
  "The characteristic sign of an inference is the word 'therefore'...
  no syllogism is formulated by Aristotle primarily as an inference,
  but they are all implications."
  Jan Lukasiewicz, _Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of
  Modern Formal Logic_, Second edition, Oxford, 1957, page 1-2.
  Lukasiewicz devised a specialized prefix notation for representing
  Aristotelian syllogisms instead of using standard predicate logic notation.

  We instead translate each Aristotelian syllogism into an inference rule,
  and each rule is defined using standard predicate logic notation and
  predicates.  The predicates are represented by wff variables
  that may depend on the quantified variable ` x ` .
  Our translation is essentially identical to the one
  use in Rini page 18, Table 2 "Non-Modal Syllogisms in
  Lower Predicate Calculus (LPC)", which uses
  standard predicate logic with predicates.  Rini states,
  "the crucial point is that we capture the meaning Aristotle intends,
  and the method by which we represent that meaning is less important."
  There are two differences: we make the existence criteria explicit, and
  we use ` ph ` , ` ps ` , and ` ch ` in the order they appear
  (a common Metamath convention).
  Patzig also uses standard predicate logic notation and predicates
  (though he interprets them as conditional propositions, not as
  inference rules); see
  Gunther Patzig, _Aristotle's Theory of the Syllogism_ second edition, 1963,
  English translation by Jonathan Barnes, 1968, page 38.
  Terms such as "all" and "some" are translated into predicate logic
  using the aproach devised by Frege and Russell.
  "Frege (and Russell) devised an ingenious procedure for regimenting
  binary quantifiers like "every" and "some" in terms of unary quantifiers
  like "everything" and "something": they formalized sentences of the form
  "Some A is B" and "Every A is B" as
  exists x (Ax and Bx) and all x (Ax implies Bx), respectively."
  "Quantifiers and Quantification", _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_,
  ~ http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quantification/ .
  See _Principia Mathematica_ page 22 and *10 for more information
  (especially *10.3 and *10.26).

  Expressions of the form "no ` ph ` is ` ps ` " are consistently translated as
  ` A. x ( ph -> -. ps ) ` .  These can also be expressed as
  ` -. E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , per ~ alinexa .
  We translate "all ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` A. x ( ph -> ps ) ` ,
  "some ` ph ` is ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ ps ) ` , and
  "some ` ph ` is not ` ps ` " to ` E. x ( ph /\ -. ps ) ` .
  It is traditional to use the singular verb "is", not the plural
  verb "are", in the generic expressions.
  By convention the major premise is listed first.

  In traditional Aristotelian syllogisms the predicates
  have a restricted form ("x is a ..."); those predicates
  could be modeled in modern notation by constructs such as
  ` x = A ` , ` x e. A ` , or ` x C_ A ` .
  Here we use wff variables instead of specialized restricted forms.
  This generalization makes the syllogisms more useful
  in more circumstances.  In addition, these expressions make
  it clearer that the syllogisms of Aristolean logic are the
  forerunners of predicate calculus.  If we used restricted forms
  like ` x e. A ` instead, we would not only unnecessarily limit
  their use, but we would also need to use set and class axioms,
  making their relationship to predicate calculus less clear.

  There are some widespread misconceptions about the existential
  assumptions made by Aristotle (aka "existential import").
  Aristotle was not trying to develop something exactly corresponding
  to modern logic.  Aristotle devised "a companion-logic for science.
  He relegates fictions like fairy godmothers and mermaids and unicorns to
  the realms of poetry and literature. In his mind, they exist outside the
  ambit of science. This is why he leaves no room for such non-existent
  entities in his logic.  This is a thoughtful choice, not an inadvertent
  omission. Technically, Aristotelian science is a search for definitions,
  where a definition is "a phrase signifying a thing's essence."
  (Topics, I.5.102a37, Pickard-Cambridge.)...
  Because non-existent entities cannot be anything, they do not, in
  Aristotle's mind, possess an essence...  This is why he leaves
  no place for fictional entities like goat-stags (or unicorns)."
  Source: Louis F. Groarke, "Aristotle: Logic",
  section 7. (Existential Assumptions),
  _Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ (A Peer-Reviewed Academic Resource),
  ~ http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-log/ .
  Thus, some syllogisms have "extra" existence
  hypotheses that do not directly appear in Aristotle's original materials
  (since they were always assumed); they are added where they are needed.
  This affects ~ barbari , ~ celaront , ~ cesaro , ~ camestros , ~ felapton ,
  ~ darapti , ~ calemos , ~ fesapo , and ~ bamalip .

  These are only the _assertic_ syllogisms.
  Aristotle also defined modal syllogisms that deal with modal
  qualifiers such as "necessarily" and "possibly".
  Historically Aristotelian modal syllogisms were not as widely used.
  For more about modal syllogisms in a modern context, see Rini as well as
  _Aristotle's Modal Syllogistic_ by Marko Malink, Harvard
  University Press, November 2013.  We do not treat them further here.

  Aristotelean logic is essentially the forerunner of predicate calculus
  (as well as set theory since it discusses membership in groups),
  while Stoic logic is essentially the forerunner of propositional calculus.

                                 SET THEORY
###############################################################################

  Set theory uses the formalism of propositional and predicate calculus to
  assert properties of arbitrary mathematical objects called "sets."  A set can
  be contained in another set, and this relationship is indicated by the ` e. `
  symbol.  Starting with the simplest mathematical object, called the empty
  set, set theory builds up more and more complex structures whose existence
  follows from the axioms, eventually resulting in extremely complicated sets
  that we identify with the real numbers and other familiar mathematical
  objects.

  Here we develop set theory based on the Intuitionistic
  Zermelo-Fraenkel (IZF) system of [Crosilla] (Crosilla's Constructive
  Zermelo-Fraenkel (CZF) is not as easy to formalize in metamath
  because the Axiom of Restricted Separation would require us to
  develop the ability to classify formulas as bounded formulas, similar
  to the machinery we have built up for asserting on whether variables
  are free in formulas).

    $( Axiom of Extensionality.  It states that two sets are identical if they
       contain the same elements.  Axiom 1 of [Crosilla] p.  "Axioms of CZF and
       IZF" (with unnnecessary quantifiers removed).

       Set theory can also be formulated with a _single_ primitive predicate
       ` e. ` on top of traditional predicate calculus _without_ equality.  In
       that case the Axiom of Extensionality becomes
       ` ( A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) -> ( x e. z -> y e. z ) ) ` , and
       equality ` x = y ` is _defined_ as ` A. w ( w e. x <-> w e. y ) ` .  All
       of the usual axioms of equality then become theorems of set theory.
       See, for example, Axiom 1 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 8.

       To use the above "equality-free" version of Extensionality with
       Metamath's logical axioms, we would rewrite ~ ax-8 through ~ ax-16 with
       equality expanded according to the above definition.  Some of those
       axioms could be proved from set theory and would be redundant.  Not all
       of them are redundant, since our axioms of predicate calculus make
       essential use of equality for the proper substitution that is a
       primitive notion in traditional predicate calculus.  A study of such an
       axiomatization would be an interesting project for someone exploring the
       foundations of logic.

       It is important to understand that strictly speaking, all of our set
       theory axioms are really schemes that represent an infinite number of
       actual axioms.  This is inherent in the design of Metamath
       ("metavariable math"), which manipulates only metavariables.  For
       example, the metavariable ` x ` in ~ ax-ext can represent any actual
       variable _v1_, _v2_, _v3_,... .  Distinct variable restrictions ($d)
       prevent us from substituting say _v1_ for both ` x ` and ` z ` .  This
       is in contrast to typical textbook presentations that present actual
       axioms (except for axioms which involve wff metavariables).  In
       practice, though, the theorems and proofs are essentially the same.  The
       $d restrictions make each of the infinite axioms generated by the
       ~ ax-ext scheme exactly logically equivalent to each other and in
       particular to the actual axiom of the textbook version.  (Contributed by

  $( Define class abstraction notation (so-called by Quine), also called a
     "class builder" in the literature. ` x ` and ` y ` need not be distinct.
     Definition 2.1 of [Quine] p. 16.  Typically, ` ph ` will have ` y ` as a
     free variable, and " ` { y | ph } ` " is read "the class of all sets ` y `
     such that ` ph ( y ) ` is true."  We do not define ` { y | ph } ` in
     isolation but only as part of an expression that extends or "overloads"
     the ` e. ` relationship.

     This is our first use of the ` e. ` symbol to connect classes instead of
     sets.  The syntax definition ~ wcel , which extends or "overloads" the
     ~ wel definition connecting set variables, requires that both sides of
     ` e. ` be a class.  In ~ df-cleq and ~ df-clel , we introduce a new kind
     of variable (class variable) that can substituted with expressions such as
     ` { y | ph } ` .  In the present definition, the ` x ` on the left-hand
     side is a set variable.  Syntax definition ~ cv allows us to substitute a
     set variable ` x ` for a class variable: all sets are classes by ~ cvjust
     (but not necessarily vice-versa).  For a full description of how classes
     are introduced and how to recover the primitive language, see the
     discussion in Quine (and under ~ abeq2 for a quick overview).

     Because class variables can be substituted with compound expressions and
     set variables cannot, it is often useful to convert a theorem containing a
     free set variable to a more general version with a class variable.

     This is called the "axiom of class comprehension" by [Levy] p. 338, who
     treats the theory of classes as an extralogical extension to our logic and
     set theory axioms.  He calls the construction ` { y | ph } ` a "class
     term".

    $( Define the equality connective between classes.  Definition 2.7 of
       [Quine] p. 18.  Also Definition 4.5 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 13; Chapter 4
       provides its justification and methods for eliminating it.  Note that
       its elimination will not necessarily result in a single wff in the
       original language but possibly a "scheme" of wffs.

       This is an example of a somewhat "risky" definition, meaning that it has
       a more complex than usual soundness justification (outside of Metamath),
       because it "overloads" or reuses the existing equality symbol rather
       than introducing a new symbol.  This allows us to make statements that
       may not hold for the original symbol.  For example, it permits us to
       deduce ` y = z <-> A. x ( x e. y <-> x e. z ) ` , which is not a theorem
       of logic but rather presupposes the Axiom of Extensionality (see theorem
       ~ axext4 ).  We therefore include this axiom as a hypothesis, so that
       the use of Extensionality is properly indicated.

       We could avoid this complication by introducing a new symbol, say =_2,
       in place of ` = ` .  This would also have the advantage of making
       elimination of the definition straightforward, so that we could
       eliminate Extensionality as a hypothesis.  We would then also have the
       advantage of being able to identify in various proofs exactly where
       Extensionality truly comes into play rather than just being an artifact
       of a definition.  One of our theorems would then be ` x ` =_2
       ` y <-> x = y ` by invoking Extensionality.

       However, to conform to literature usage, we retain this overloaded
       definition.  This also makes some proofs shorter and probably easier to
       read, without the constant switching between two kinds of equality.

       See also comments under ~ df-clab , ~ df-clel , and ~ abeq2 .

       In the form of ~ dfcleq , this is called the "axiom of extensionality"
       by [Levy] p. 338, who treats the theory of classes as an extralogical
       extension to our logic and set theory axioms.

    $( Equality of a class variable and a class abstraction (also called a
       class builder).  Theorem 5.1 of [Quine] p. 34.  This theorem shows the
       relationship between expressions with class abstractions and expressions
       with class variables.  Note that ~ abbi and its relatives are among
       those useful for converting theorems with class variables to equivalent
       theorems with wff variables, by first substituting a class abstraction
       for each class variable.

       Class variables can always be eliminated from a theorem to result in an
       equivalent theorem with wff variables, and vice-versa.  The idea is
       roughly as follows.  To convert a theorem with a wff variable ` ph `
       (that has a free variable ` x ` ) to a theorem with a class variable
       ` A ` , we substitute ` x e. A ` for ` ph ` throughout and simplify,
       where ` A ` is a new class variable not already in the wff.  Conversely,
       to convert a theorem with a class variable ` A ` to one with ` ph ` , we
       substitute ` { x | ph } ` for ` A ` throughout and simplify, where ` x `
       and ` ph ` are new set and wff variables not already in the wff.  For
       more information on class variables, see Quine pp. 15-21 and/or Takeuti
       and Zaring pp. 10-13.  (Contributed by NM, 5-Aug-1993.) $)

       Theorem 6.9 of [Quine] p. 43. _Notational convention_:  We will use the

                    Conditional equality (experimental)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  This is a very useless definition, which "abbreviates" ` ( x = y -> ph ) ` as
  ` CondEq ( x = y -> ph ) ` . What this display hides, though, is that the
  first expression, even though it has a shorter constant string, is actually
  much more complicated in its parse tree: it is parsed as
  (wi (wceq (cv vx) (cv vy)) wph), while the ` CondEq ` version is parsed as
  (wcdeq vx vy wph).  It also allows us to give a name to the specific 3-ary
  operation ` ( x = y -> ph ) ` .

  This is all used as part of a metatheorem: we want to say that
  ` |- ( x = y -> ( ph ( x ) <-> ph ( y ) ) ) ` and
  ` |- ( x = y -> A ( x ) = A ( y ) ) ` are provable, for any expressions
  ` ph ( x ) ` or ` A ( x ) ` in the language.  The proof is by induction, so
  the base case is each of the primitives, which is why you will see a theorem
  for each of the set.mm primitive operations.

  The metatheorem comes with a disjoint variables assumption: every variable in
  ` ph ( x ) ` is assumed disjoint from ` x ` except ` x ` itself.  For such a
  proof by induction, we must consider each of the possible forms of
  ` ph ( x ) ` .  If it is a variable other than ` x ` , then we have
  ` CondEq ( x = y -> A = A ) ` or ` CondEq ( x = y -> ( ph <-> ph ) ) ` ,
  which is provable by ~ cdeqth and reflexivity.  Since we are only working
  with class and wff expressions, it can't be ` x ` itself in set.mm, but if it
  was we'd have to also prove ` CondEq ( x = y -> x = y ) ` (where _set_
  equality is being used on the right).

  Otherwise, it is a primitive operation applied to smaller expressions.  In
  these cases, for each set variable parameter to the operation, we must
  consider if it is equal to ` x ` or not, which yields 2^n proof obligations.
  Luckily, all primitive operations in set.mm have either zero or one set
  variable, so we only need to prove one statement for the non-set constructors
  (like implication) and two for the constructors taking a set (the forall and
  the class builder).

  In each of the primitive proofs, we are allowed to assume that ` y ` is
  disjoint from ` ph ( x ) ` and vice versa, because this is maintained through
  the induction.  This is how we satisfy the DV assumptions of ~ cdeqab1 and
  ~ cdeqab .

    $( Russell's Paradox.  Proposition 4.14 of [TakeutiZaring] p. 14.

       In the late 1800s, Frege's Axiom of (unrestricted) Comprehension,
       expressed in our notation as ` A e. _V ` , asserted that any collection
       of sets ` A ` is a set i.e. belongs to the universe ` _V ` of all sets.
       In particular, by substituting ` { x | x e/ x } ` (the "Russell class")
       for ` A ` , it asserted ` { x | x e/ x } e. _V ` , meaning that the
       "collection of all sets which are not members of themselves" is a set.
       However, here we prove ` { x | x e/ x } e/ _V ` .  This contradiction
       was discovered by Russell in 1901 (published in 1903), invalidating the
       Comprehension Axiom and leading to the collapse of Frege's system.

       In 1908, Zermelo rectified this fatal flaw by replacing Comprehension
       with a weaker Subset (or Separation) Axiom asserting that ` A ` is a set
       only when it is smaller than some other set ` B ` .  The intuitionistic
       set theory IZF includes such a separation axiom, Axiom 6 of [Crosilla]
       p.  "Axioms of CZF and IZF", which we include as ~ ax-sep .

     classes.

     Our definition also does not produce the same results as discussed in the
     proof of Theorem 6.6 of [Quine] p. 42 (although Theorem 6.6 itself does
     hold, as shown by ~ dfsbcq below).  Unfortunately, Quine's definition
     requires a recursive syntactical breakdown of ` ph ` , and it does not
     seem possible to express it with a single closed formula.

     If we did not want to commit to any specific proper class behavior, we
     could use this definition _only_ to prove theorem ~ dfsbcq , which holds
     for both our definition and Quine's, and from which we can derive a weaker
     version of ~ df-sbc in the form of ~ sbc8g .  However, the behavior of
     Quine's definition at proper classes is similarly arbitrary, and for
     practical reasons (to avoid having to prove sethood of ` A ` in every use
     of this definition) we allow direct reference to ~ df-sbc and assert that
     ` [. A / x ]. ph ` is always false when ` A ` is a proper class.

     The related definition df-csb defines proper substitution into a class

  $( This theorem, which is similar to Theorem 6.7 of [Quine] p. 42 and holds
     under both our definition and Quine's, provides us with a weak definition
     of the proper substitution of a class for a set.  Since our ~ df-sbc does
     not result in the same behavior as Quine's for proper classes, if we
     wished to avoid conflict with Quine's definition we could start with this
     theorem and ~ dfsbcq2 instead of ~ df-sbc .  ( ~ dfsbcq2 is needed because
     unlike Quine we do not overload the ~ df-sb syntax.)  As a consequence of
     these theorems, we can derive ~ sbc8g , which is a weaker version of
     ~ df-sbc that leaves substitution undefined when ` A ` is a proper class.

     However, it is often a nuisance to have to prove the sethood hypothesis of
     ~ sbc8g , so we will allow direct use of ~ df-sbc .  Proper substiution
     with a proper class is rarely needed, and when it is, we can simply use
     the expansion of Quine's definition.  (Contributed by NM, 14-Apr-1995.) $)

       we define it to be empty in this case (see ~ opprc1 and ~ opprc2 ).  For
       Kuratowski's actual definition when the arguments are sets, see ~ dfop .

       Definition 9.1 of [Quine] p. 58 defines an ordered pair unconditionally
       as ` <. A , B >. = { { A } , { A , B } } ` , which has different
       behavior from our ~ df-op when the arguments are proper classes.
       Ordinarily this difference is not important, since neither definition is
       meaningful in that case.  Our ~ df-op was chosen because it often makes
       proofs shorter by eliminating unnecessary sethood hypotheses.

       There are other ways to define ordered pairs.  The basic requirement is
       that two ordered pairs are equal iff their respective members are
       equal.  In 1914 Norbert Wiener gave the first successful definition
       ` <. A , B >. ` _2 ` = { { { A } , (/) } , { { B } } } ` .  This was
       simplified by Kazimierz Kuratowski in 1921 to our present definition.
       An even simpler definition is ` <. A , B >. ` _3
       ` = { A , { A , B } } ` , but it requires the Axiom of Regularity for
       its justification and is not commonly used.  Finally, an ordered pair of
       real numbers can be represented by a complex number.  (Contributed by

    $( Define indexed union.  Definition indexed union in [Stoll] p. 45.  In
       most applications, ` A ` is independent of ` x ` (although this is not
       required by the definition), and ` B ` depends on ` x ` i.e. can be read
       informally as ` B ( x ) ` .  We call ` x ` the index, ` A ` the index
       set, and ` B ` the indexed set.  In most books, ` x e. A ` is written as
       a subscript or underneath a union symbol ` U. ` .  We use a special
       union symbol ` U_ ` to make it easier to distinguish from plain class
       union.  In many theorems, you will see that ` x ` and ` A ` are in the
       same distinct variable group (meaning ` A ` cannot depend on ` x ` ) and
       that ` B ` and ` x ` do not share a distinct variable group (meaning
       that can be thought of as ` B ( x ) ` i.e. can be substituted with a
       class expression containing ` x ` ).  An alternate definition tying
       indexed union to ordinary union is ~ dfiun2 .  Theorem ~ uniiun provides
       a definition of ordinary union in terms of indexed union.  (Contributed

     prime (apostrophe-like) symbol, such as Definition 6 of [Suppes] p. 134
     and the definition of successor in [Mendelson] p. 246 (who uses the symbol
     "Suc" as a predicate to mean "is a successor ordinal").  The definition of
     successor of [Enderton] p. 68 denotes the operation with a plus-sign
     superscript.  (Contributed by NM, 30-Aug-1993.) $)

    $( Axiom of Union.  An axiom of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set
       theory.  It states that a set ` y ` exists that includes the union of a
       given set ` x ` i.e. the collection of all members of the members of
       ` x ` .  The variant ~ axun2 states that the union itself exists.  A
       version with the standard abbreviation for union is ~ uniex2 .  A
       version using class notation is ~ uniex .

       This is Axiom 3 of [Crosilla] p.  "Axioms of CZF and IZF", except (a)
       unnecessary quantifiers are removed, (b) Crosilla has a biconditional
       rather than an implication (but the two are equivalent by ~ bm1.3ii ),
       and (c) the order of the conjuncts is swapped (which is equivalent by
       ~ ancom ).

       The union of a class ~ df-uni should not be confused with the union of
       two classes ~ df-un .  Their relationship is shown in ~ unipr .

                 Mathbox guidelines
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  $( (_This theorem is a dummy placeholder for these guidelines.  The name of
     this theorem, "mathbox", is hard-coded into the Metamath program to
     identify the start of the mathbox section for web page generation_.)

     A "mathbox" is a user-contributed section that is maintained by its
     contributor independently from the main part of set.mm.

     _For contributors_:

     By making a contribution, you agree to release it into the public domain,
     according to the statement at the beginning of set.mm.

     Mathboxes are provided to help keep your work synchronized with changes in
     set.mm, but they shouldn't be depended on as a permanent archive.  If you
     want to preserve your original contribution, it is your responsibility to
     keep your own copy of it along with the version of set.mm that works with
     it.

     _Guidelines_:

     1.  If at all possible, please use only 0-ary class constants for new
     definitions.

     2.  Try to follow the style of the rest of set.mm.  Each $p and $a
     statement must be immediately preceded with the comment that will be shown
     on its web page description.  The metamath program command "write source
     set.mm /rewrap" will take care of wrapping comment lines and indentation
     conventions.  All mathbox content will be on public display and should
     hopefully reflect the overall quality of the website.

     3.  Before submitting a revised mathbox, please make sure it verifies
     against the current set.mm.

     4.  Mathboxes should be independent i.e. the proofs should verify with all
     other mathboxes removed.  If you need a theorem from another mathbox, that
     is fine (and encouraged), but let me know, so I can move the theorem to
     the main section.  One way avoid undesired accidental use of other mathbox
     theorems is to develop your mathbox using a modified set.mm that has
     mathboxes removed.

     _Notes_:

     1.  We may decide to move some theorems to the main part of set.mm for
     general use.

     2.  We may make changes to mathboxes to maintain the overall quality of
     set.mm.  Normally we will let you know if a change might impact what you
     are working on.

     3.  If you use theorems from another user's mathbox, we don't provide
     assurance that they are based on correct or consistent $a statements.  (If
     you find such a problem, please let us know so it can be corrected.)
