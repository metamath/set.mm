<H1>Metamath Mailing List</H1>
<P>
We welcome everyone who is interested in Metamath to join the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/metamath">Metamath
mailing list</a>, which discusses all topics related to Metamath.
Metamath is a tiny language that can express theorems in abstract mathematics, accompanied by proofs that can be verified by a computer program.
</P>

<P>
We ask that you follow common netiquette rules for mailing lists. In short, respect others' time. For example:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Use a descriptive subject that describes the content of your post. If you're changing to a new subject, please start a new thread with the new subject. You can show a relationship with a previous subject by using a subject like NEW_SUBJECT (was: OLD_SUBJECT).</LI>
<LI>Please avoid replying to yourself (unless it's just occasionally for a quick correction), and allow others time to respond. The point of a mailing list is to enable discussion, not monologue.</LI>
<LI>Avoid unnecessary material. Don't just post me-too posts, and quote only what you need to make your point clear.</LI>
<LI>Use bottom-posting or interleaved quoting. This makes posts easier to understand.</LI>
<LI>Try to post in normal next and *not* rich text. Posting in HTML is allowed, but don't assume that everyone reading the message can see the formatting.</LI>
<LI>Don't shout (that is, post in all-caps).</LI>
<LI>Avoid personal attacks. Disagreement on ideas is fine (and expected).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
There may be occasional lapses, the point is that everyone should *try* to respect others' time.
</P>

<P>
Postings that do not follow these guidelines are subject to removal, and posters who repeatedly do not follow these guidelines are subject to added moderation or removal. We need to be able to do this to ensure that the mailing list meets its objective.
</P>
