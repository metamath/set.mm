(7-Aug-2021) Version <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.198</A> of the
metamath program fixes a bug in "write source ... /rewrap" that
prevented end-of-sentence punctuation from appearing in column 79, causing
some rewrapped lines to be shorter than necessary.  Because this affects
about 2000 lines in set.mm, you should use version 0.198 or later
for rewrapping before submitting to GitHub.

(10-Aug-2019) (revised 21-Sep-2019) Version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.178</A> of the metamath program has the
following changes:  (1) "minimize_with" will now prevent dependence on
new $a statements unless the new qualifier "/allow_new_axioms" is
specified.  For routine usage, it is suggested that you use
"minimize_with * /allow_new_axioms * /no_new_axioms_from ax-*" instead
of just "minimize_with *".  See "help minimize_with" and this <A

(16-May-2019) Set.mm now has a major new section on <A
HREF="mmtheorems.html#cstrkg">elementary geometry</A>.  This begins with
definitions that implement Tarski's axioms of geometry (including
concepts such as congruence and betweenness).  This uses set.mm's
extensible structures, making them easier to use for many circumstances.
The section then connects Tarski geometry with geometry in Euclidean
places.  Most of the work in this section is due to Thierry Arnoux, with
earlier work by Mario Carneiro and Scott Fenton. [Reported by DAW.]<P>

names.  See <A HREF="mmascii.html">mmascii.html</A> near the 50th table
row, starting with "./\".
<!-- We are
still trying to decide on a generic way to distinguish them from ordinary
symbols by some means other than color (for those who are color blind
and for printing
unambiguously in black
and white).  The page <A
HREF="../mpeuni/mmtheorems271.html">mmtheorems271</A> shows examples of
the use of these symbols.  In the current experiment, a dotted underline is
the default, and to compare a dotted
box (on mpeuni pages), use View -> Page Sytle -> mmsetalt (Firefox) or
View -> Style -> mmsetalt (IE).

<!--
<BR> &bullet; We note that the first use of colored
symbols as variables was by FL in 2010.  See for example theorem <A

topic.  Two commands, htmlcss and htmlfont, were added to the
$t comment in set.mm and are recognized by
Metamath program version <A

<P>(21-Dec-2015) Axiom ax-12, now renamed <A HREF="ax-12o.html">ax-12o</A>,
was replaced by a new shorter equivalent, <A
HREF="ax-12.html">ax-12</A>.  The equivalence is provided by theorems <A
HREF="ax12o.html">ax12o</A> and <A HREF="ax12.html">ax12</A>.
<!-- To better
isolate some of the axiomatics, I added a new axiom, <A
HREF="ax-9v.html">ax-9v</A>, which is <A HREF="ax-9.html">ax-9</A>
weakened with a $d.  It is used to derive the 3 theorems <A

<P>(13-Jun-2015) Stefan O'Rear's <A
HREF="https://github.com/sorear/smm">smm</A>, written in JavaScript, can
now be used as a standalone proof verifier. This brings the total number of
<A HREF="../index.html#otherpgms">independent Metamath verifiers</A> to
8, written in just as many languages (C, Java.  JavaScript, Python,
Haskell, Lua, C#, C++).

<P>(12-Jun-2015) David A. Wheeler added 2 new proofs to the <A
HREF="../mm_100.html">100 theorem list</A>:  The Law of Cosines <A
HREF="lawcos.html">lawcos</A> and Ptolemy's Theorem <A
HREF="ptolemy.html">ptolemy</A>, bringing the Metamath total to 52.

<P>(30-May-2015) The metamath program has been updated to version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.117</A>.  (1) David A. Wheeler provided an
enhancement to speed up the 'improve' command by 28%; see  <A
HREF="../metamath/README.TXT">README.TXT</A>  for more information.
(2) In web pages with proofs, local hyperlinks on step hypotheses no
longer clip the Expression cell at the top of the page.

<P>(9-May-2015) Stefan O'Rear has created an archive of older set.mm
releases back to 1998:  <A
HREF="https://github.com/sorear/set.mm-history/">
https://github.com/sorear/set.mm-history/</A>.


<P>(7-May-2015) The set.mm dated 7-May-2015 is a major revision, updated by
Mario, that incorporates the new ordered pair definition <A
HREF="df-op.html">df-op</A> that was agreed upon.  There were
700 changes, listed at the top of set.mm.  <I>Mathbox users are
advised to update their local mathboxes.</I>  As usual, if any
mathbox user has trouble incorporating these changes into their mathbox
in progress, Mario or I will be glad to do them for you.


<P>(7-May-2015) Mario has added 4 new theorems to the
<A HREF="../mm_100.html">100 theorem list</A>:
Ramsey's Theorem <A HREF="ramsey.html">ramsey</A>,
The Solution of a Cubic <A HREF="cubic.html">cubic</A>,
The Solution of the General Quartic Equation
   <A HREF="quart.html">quart</a>, and
The Birthday Problem <A HREF="birthday.html">birthday</A>.
In the Supplementary List, Stefan O'Rear added the
Hilbert Basis Theorem <A HREF="hbt.html">hbt</A>.


<P>(28-Apr-2015) A while ago, Mario Carneiro wrote up a proof of the
unambiguity of set.mm's grammar, which has now been added to this site:
<A HREF="../downloads/grammar-ambiguity.txt">grammar-ambiguity.txt</A>.


<P>(22-Apr-2015) The metamath program has been updated to version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.114</A>.  In MM-PA, 'show new_proof/unknown'
now shows the relative offset (-1, -2,...) used for 'assign' arguments,
suggested by Stefan O'Rear.


<P>(20-Apr-2015) I retrieved an old version of the missing "Metamath 100"
page from archive.org and updated it to what I think is the current
state:  <A HREF="../mm_100.html">mm_100.html</A>.  Anyone who wants to
edit it can email updates to this page to me.


<P>(19-Apr-2015) The metamath program has been updated to version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.113</A>, mostly with patches provided by
Stefan O'Rear.  (1) 'show statement %' (or any command allowing label
wildcards) will select statements whose proofs were changed in current
session.  ('help search' will show all wildcard matching rules.)  (2)
'show statement =' will select the statement being proved in MM-PA.
(3) The proof
date stamp is now created only if the proof is complete.

<P>(18-Apr-2015) There is now a section for Scott Fenton's NF database:  <A
HREF="../nfegif/mmnf.html">New Foundations Explorer</A>.

<P>(16-Apr-2015) Mario describes his recent additions to set.mm at <A
HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/VAGNmzFkHCs">
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/metamath/VAGNmzFkHCs</A>.  It
include 2 new additions to the <A

 bringing the Metamath total for <A
HREF="../mm_100.html">Formalizing
100 Theorems</A> to 40.

<P>(22-Nov-2014) The metamath program has been updated with version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.111</A>.  (1) Label wildcards now have a
label range indicator "~" so that e.g. you can show or search all of the
statements in a mathbox.  See 'help search'.  (Stefan O'Rear added this
to the program.)  (2) A qualifier was added to 'minimize_with' to
prevent the use of any axioms not already used in the proof e.g.
'minimize_with * /no_new_axioms_from ax-*' will prevent the use of ax-ac
if the proof doesn't already use it.  See 'help minimize_with'.

<P>(10-Oct-2014) Mario Carneiro has encoded the axiomatic basis for
the HOL theorem prover into a Metamath source file,
<A HREF="../metamath/hol.mm">hol.mm</A>.

Calculus (<A HREF="ftc1.html">ftc1</A>, <A HREF="ftc2.html">ftc2</A>).
This brings the Metamath total for <A
HREF="../mm_100.html">Formalizing
100 Theorems</A> to 35.  <I>(added 14-Sep-2014)</I> Along the way, he
added the Mean Value Theorem (<A HREF="mvth.html">mvth</A>), bringing
the total to 36.

<P>(16-Aug-2014) Mario Carneiro started a Metamath blog at
<A HREF="http://metamath-blog.blogspot.com/">
http://metamath-blog.blogspot.com/</A>.

<P>(10-Aug-2014) Mario Carneiro added Erd&#337;s's proof of the divergence
of the inverse prime series (<A HREF="prmrec.html">prmrec</A>).  This
brings the Metamath total for <A

6PCM conference</A>.
<A HREF="../ocat/natded.pdf">Slides</A>
<A HREF="../ocat/natded.mp3">Audio</A>

<P>(25-Jun-2014) In version <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.108</A> of the
metamath program, the 'minimize_with' command is now more automated.  It
now considers compressed proof length; it scans the statements in
forward and reverse order and chooses the best; and it avoids $d
conflicts.  The '/no_distinct', '/brief', and '/reverse' qualifiers are
obsolete, and '/verbose' no longer lists all statements scanned but
gives more details about decision criteria.


<P>(12-Jun-2014) To improve naming uniformity, theorems about operation
values now use the abbreviation "ov".  For example, df-opr, opreq1,
oprabval5, and oprvres are now called
<A HREF="df-ov.html">df-ov</A>,
<A HREF="oveq1.html">oveq1</A>,
<A HREF="ov5.html">ov5</A>, and
<A HREF="ovres.html">ovres</A>
respectively.

<P>(11-Jun-2014) Mario Carneiro finished a major revision of set.mm.
His notes are under the 11-Jun-2014 entry in the
<A HREF="mmnotes.txt">Notes</A>

<P>(4-Jun-2014) Mario Carneiro provided instructions and screenshots for <A
HREF="../screen1.html#jedit">syntax highlighting for the jEdit
editor</A> for use with Metamath and mmj2 source files.

<P>(19-May-2014) Mario Carneiro added a feature to <A
HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A>, in the build at <A
HREF="https://github.com/digama0/mmj2/raw/dev-build/mmj2jar/mmj2.jar">
https://github.com/digama0/mmj2/raw/dev-build/mmj2jar/mmj2.jar</A>, which
tests all but 5 definitions in set.mm for soundness.  You can turn on
the test by adding <BR><TT>
SetMMDefinitionsCheckWithExclusions,ax-*,df-bi,df-clab,df-cleq,df-clel,df-sbc
</TT><BR> to your RunParms.txt file.

<P>(17-May-2014) A number of labels were changed in set.mm, listed at the
top of set.mm as usual.  Note in particular that the heavily-used
visset, elisseti, syl11anc, syl111anc were changed respectively to vex,
elexi, syl2anc, syl3anc.

<P>(16-May-2014) Scott Fenton formalized a proof for "Sum of kth powers":
<A HREF="fsumkthpow.html">fsumkthpow</A>.  This brings the Metamath total for
<A

100 Theorems</A> to 25.

<P>(9-May-2014) I (Norm Megill) presented an overview of Metamath at the <A
HREF="https://ihp2014.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/doku.php?id=workshop_1">
"Formalization of mathematics in proof assistants"</A> workshop at the

Henri Poincar�</A> in Paris.  The slides for this talk are <A
HREF="../downloads/ihp2014mm.pdf">here</A>.


<P>(22-Jun-2014) Version <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.107</A> of the
metamath program adds a "PART" indention level to the Statement List
table of contents, adds 'show proof ...  /size' to show source file
bytes used, and adds 'show elapsed_time'.  The last one is helpful for
measuring the run time of long commands.  See 'help write theorem_list',
'help show proof', and 'help show elapsed_time' for more information.

<P>(2-May-2014) Scott Fenton formalized a proof of Sum of the
Reciprocals of the Triangular Numbers:  <A
HREF="trirecip.html">trirecip</A>.  This brings the Metamath total for
<A
HREF="../mm_100.html">Formalizing
100 Theorems</A> to 24.

<P>(19-Apr-2014) Scott Fenton formalized a proof of the Formula for
Pythagorean Triples:  <A HREF="pythagtrip.html">pythagtrip</A>.  This
brings the Metamath total for <A
HREF="../mm_100.html">Formalizing
100 Theorems</A> to 23.

<P>(11-Apr-2014) David A. Wheeler produced a much-needed and well-done
video for <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A>, called <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rst2hZpWUbU">"Introduction to
Metamath &amp; mmj2"</A>.  Thanks, David!

<P>(15-Mar-2014) Mario Carneiro formalized a proof of Bertrand's postulate:
<A HREF="bpos.html">bpos</A>.
This brings the Metamath total for
<A
HREF="../mm_100.html">Formalizing
 100 Theorems</A> to 22.

<P>(18-Feb-2014) Mario Carneiro proved that complex number axiom ax-cnex
is redundant (theorem <A HREF="cnex.html">cnex</A>).  See also
<A HREF="mmcomplex.html#axioms">Real and Complex Numbers</A>.

<P>(11-Feb-2014) David A. Wheeler has created a <A
HREF="../mm_100.html">theorem
compilation</A> that tracks those theorems in Freek Wiedijk's <A
HREF="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/">Formalizing 100 Theorems</A> list
that have been proved in set.mm.  If you find a error or omission in
this list, let me know so it can be corrected.  (Update
1-Mar-2014: Mario has added <A HREF="eulerth.html">eulerth</A>
and <A HREF="bezout.html">bezout</A> to the list.)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The latest commit on the mmj2
development branch introduced an exciting new feature, namely syntax
highlighting for mmp files in the main window.  (You can pick up the
latest mmj2.jar at
<A HREF="https://github.com/digama0/mmj2/blob/develop/mmj2jar/mmj2.jar">
https://github.com/digama0/mmj2/blob/develop/mmj2jar/mmj2.jar</A> .) The
reason I am asking for your help at this stage is to help with design
for the syntax tokenizer, which is responsible for breaking down the
input into various tokens with names like "comment", "set", and
"stephypref", which are then colored according to the user's preference.
As users of mmj2 and metamath, what types of highlighting would be
useful to you?

<P>One limitation of the tokenizer is that since (for performance reasons)
it can be started at any line in the file, highly contextual coloring,
like highlighting step references that don't exist previously in the
file, is difficult to do.  Similarly, true parsing of the formulas using
the grammar is possible but likely to be unmanageably slow.  But things
like checking theorem labels against the database is quite simple to do
under the current setup.

<P>That said, how can this new feature be optimized to help you when writing
proofs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(13-Jan-2014) Mathbox users:  the *19.21a*, *19.23a* series of theorems
have been renamed to *alrim*, *exlim*.  You can update your mathbox with
a global replacement of string '19.21a' with 'alrim' and '19.23a' with
'exlim'.

<P>(5-Jan-2014) If you downloaded <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A>
in the past 3 days, please update it with the current version, which
fixes a bug introduced by the recent changes that made it unable
to read in most of the proofs in the textarea properly.

<P>(4-Jan-2014) I added a list of "Allowed substitutions" under the
"Distinct variable groups" list on the theorem web pages, for
example <A HREF="axsep.html">axsep</A>.  This is an experimental
feature and comments are welcome.

<P>(3-Jan-2014) Version <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.102</A> of the
metamath program produces more space-efficient compressed proofs
(still compatible with the specification in Appendix B of the <A
HREF="../index.html#book"><I>Metamath</I></A> book) using an algorithm
suggested by Mario Carneiro.  See 'help save proof' in the program.
Also, <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A> now generates proofs in the
new format.  The new mmj2 also has a mandatory update that fixes a bug
related to the new format; you <i>must</i> update your mmj2 copy to use
it with the latest set.mm.

<P>(23-Dec-2013) Mario Carneiro has updated many older definitions to use the
<A HREF="df-mpt.html">maps-to notation</A>.  If you have
difficulty updating your local mathbox, contact him or me for
assistance.

<P>(1-Nov-2013) 'undo' and 'redo' commands were added to the Proof
Assistant in metamath program version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.07.99</A>.  See 'help undo' in the
program.

<P>(8-Oct-2013) Today's <A HREF="mmnotes.txt">Notes</A> entry describes
some proof repair techniques.

<P>(5-Oct-2013) Today's <A HREF="mmnotes.txt">Notes</A> entry explains

<P>(18-Jun-2013) Mario Carneiro has done a major revision and cleanup of
the construction of <A HREF="mmcomplex.html"> real and complex
numbers</A>.  In particular, rather than using equivalence classes as is
customary for the construction of the temporary rationals, he used only
"reduced fractions", so that the use of the axiom of infinity is avoided

<P>(18-May-2013) Mario Carneiro has added the ability to produce compressed
proofs to <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A>.  This is <I>not</I> an

<P>(8-Mar-2013) Wolf Lammen has reorganized the theorems in the "Logical
negation" section of set.mm into a more orderly, less scattered
arrangement.

<P>(27-Feb-2013) Scott Fenton has done a large cleanup of set.mm, eliminating
*OLD references in 144 proofs.  See the  <A HREF="mmnotes.txt">Notes</A>
entry for 27-Feb-2013.

<P>(21-Feb-2013) *ATTENTION MATHBOX USERS* The order of hypotheses of
many syl* theorems were changed, per a suggestion of Mario Carneiro.
You need to update your local mathbox copy for compatibility with the
new set.mm, or I can do it for you if you wish.  See the <A
HREF="mmnotes.txt">Notes</A> entry for 21-Feb-2013.


<P>(16-Feb-2013) Scott Fenton shortened the direct-from-axiom
 proofs of *3.1, *3.43, *4.4, *4.41, *4.5, *4.76,
*4.83, *5.33, *5.35, *5.36, and meredith in the

"I've updated Ralph Levien's <A
HREF="../index.html#mmverify">mmverify.py</A>. It's now a Python 3 program,
and supports compressed proofs and file inclusion statements.
 This adds about fifty lines to the original program. Enjoy!"


<P>(10-Jan-2013) A new mathbox was added for Mario Carneiro, who has
contributed a number of cardinality theorems without invoking the Axiom
of Choice.  This is nice work, and
I will be using some of these (those suffixed with "NEW") to
replace the existing ones in the main part of set.mm that currently invoke
AC unnecessarily.


<P>(4-Jan-2013) As mentioned in the 19-Jun-2012 item
below, Eric Schmidt discovered that the complex number axioms
<A HREF="addcom.html">axaddcom (now addcom)</A> and
<A HREF="addid1.html">ax0id (now addid1)</A> are redundant
(<A HREF="../downloads/schmidt-cnaxioms.pdf">schmidt-cnaxioms.pdf</A>,
<A HREF="../downloads/schmidt-cnaxioms.tex"> .tex</A>).
In addition, <A HREF="mulid1.html">ax1id (now mulid1)</A> can be
weakened to <A HREF="ax1rid.html">ax1rid</A>.
Scott Fenton has now formalized this work,
so that now there are 23 instead of 25 axioms for real and
complex numbers in set.mm.   The
<A HREF="mmcomplex.html">Axioms for Complex Numbers</A>

<P>(19-Jun-2012) Eric Schmidt has discovered that in our

<A HREF="axaddcom.html">axaddcom</A> and
<A HREF="ax0id.html">ax0id</A> are redundant.

He has written up
these and some other nice results, including some independence
results for the axioms, in

developed with Lamport's
<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/latex/pf2.pdf">
pf2</A> package.  He wrote:  "I think it works
well with Metamath since the proofs are in a tree form.  I use it to have
a sketch of a proof.  I get this way a better understanding of the proof
and I can cut down its size.  For instance,
<A HREF="inpreima5.html">inpreima5</A> was reduced by 50%
when I wrote the corresponding proof with pf2."


<P>(5-Mar-2012) I added links to Wikiproofs and its recent changes

<P>(24-Nov-2011) In metamath program version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.07.71</A>,
the 'minimize_with' command
by default now scans from bottom to top instead of top to
bottom, since empirically this often (although not always) results in
a shorter proof.  A top to bottom scan can be specified with a
new qualifier '/reverse'.  You can try both methods
(starting from the same original proof, of course) and pick the
shorter proof.


<P>(15-Oct-2011) From Mel O'Cat:
<BR>
I just uploaded mmj2.zip containing the 1-Nov-2011 (20111101)
release:

<A HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:88/ocat/mmj2/mmj2.md5">http://us2.metamath.org:88/ocat/mmj2/mmj2.md5</A>
<BR>A few last minute tweaks:
<BR>1. I now bless double-click starting of mmj2.bat (MacMMJ2.command in Mac OS-X)!
See mmj2\QuickStart.html
<BR>2. Much improved support of Mac OS-X systems.
See mmj2\QuickStart.html
<BR>3. I tweaked the Command Line Argument Options report to
<BR>a) print every time;
<BR>b) print as much as possible even if
    there are errors in the command line arguments -- and the
    last line printed corresponds to the argument in error;
<BR>c) removed Y/N argument on the command line to enable/disable
the report. this simplifies things.
<BR>4) Documentation revised, including the PATutorial.
<BR>See CHGLOG.TXT for list of all changes.
Good luck. And thanks for all of your help!

<P>(7-Ju1-2011) Mel O'Cat has released a new version of

mmj2.zip</A>.   See the  readme file.
-->

<P>(4-Jul-2011) John Baker has provided (<A
HREF="../downloads/metamath_kindle.zip">metamath_kindle.zip</A>) "a
modified version of [the] metamath.tex [<A
HREF="../index.html#book"><I>Metamath</I></A>] book source that is
formatted for the Kindle.  If you compile the document the resulting PDF
can be loaded into into a Kindle and easily read."  (Update: the PDF
file is now included also.)

<P>(3-Jul-2011) Nested 'submit' calls are now allowed, in metamath
program version <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.07.68</A>.
Thus you can create or modify a command file (script) from within
a command file then 'submit' it.  While 'submit' cannot pass
arguments (nor are there plans to add this feature), you can
'substitute' strings in the 'submit' target file before calling
it in order to emulate this.

<P>(28-Jun-2011)The metamath program version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">0.07.64</A> adds the '/include_mathboxes'
qualifier to 'minimize_with'; by default, 'minimize_with *' will now
skip checking user mathboxes.  Since mathboxes should be independent
from each other, this will help prevent accidental
cross-"contamination".  Also, '/rewrap' was added to 'write source' to
automatically wrap $a and $p comments so as to conform to the current
formatting conventions used in set.mm.  This means you no longer have to
be concerned about line length &lt; 80 etc.

<P>(19-Jun-2011) ATTENTION MATHBOX USERS:  The wff variables et, ze, si,
and rh are now global.  This change was made primarily to resolve some
conflicts between mathboxes, but it will also let you avoid having to
constantly redeclare these locally in the future.  Unfortunately, this
change can affect the $f hypothesis order, which can cause proofs
referencing theorems that use these variables to fail.  All mathbox
proofs currently in set.mm have been corrected for this, and you should
refresh your local copy for further development of your mathbox.  You
can correct your proofs that are not in set.mm as follows.  Only the
proofs that fail under the current set.mm (using <A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/index.html#mmprog">version
0.07.62</A> or later of the metamath program) need to be modified.

<P>To fix a proof that references earlier theorems using et, ze, si, and
rh, do the following (using a hypothetical theorem 'abc' as an example):
'prove abc' (ignore error messages), 'delete floating', 'initialize
all', 'unify all/interactive', 'improve all', 'save
new_proof/compressed'.  If your proof uses dummy variables, these must
be reassigned manually.

<P>To fix a proof that uses et, ze, si, and rh as local variables, make
sure the proof is saved in 'compressed' format.  Then delete the local
declarations ($v and $f statements) and follow the same steps above to
correct the proof.

<P>I apologize for the inconvenience.  If you have trouble fixing
your proofs, you can contact me for assistance.

<P>Note:  Versions of the metamath program before 0.07.62 did not flag an
error when global variables were redeclared locally, as it should have
according to the spec.  This caused these spec violations to go
unnoticed in some older set.mm versions.  The new error messages are in
fact just informational and can be ignored when working with older
set.mm versions.

<P>


<P>(7-Jun-2011) The metamath program version <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">
0.07.60</A> fixes a bug with the 'minimize_with' command found by
Andrew Salmon.

<P>(12-May-2010) Andrew Salmon shortened many proofs, shown above.
For comparison, I have temporarily kept the old version, which
is suffixed with OLD, such as oridmOLD for oridm.

<P>(9-Dec-2010) Eric Schmidt has written a Metamath proof verifier in
C++, called <A HREF="../downloads/checkmm.cpp">checkmm.cpp</A>.

<P>(3-Oct-2010) The following changes were made to the tokens in set.mm.
The subset and proper subset symbol changes to C_ and C.
were made to prevent defeating the parenthesis
matching in Emacs.  Other changes were made so that all letters a-z
and A-Z are now available for variable names.  One-letter constants such
as _V, _e, and _i are now shown on the web pages with Roman instead of italic
font, to disambiguate italic variable names.
The new convention is that a prefix of _ indicates Roman
font and a prefix of ~ indicates a script (curly) font.
Thanks to  Stefan Allan and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Lin&eacute;
for discussions leading to this change.

<P>(14-Sep-2010) The metamath program (<A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/index.html#mmprog">version
0.07.52</A>) has a revamped LaTeX output with 'show statement xxx
/tex', which produces the combined statement, description, and proof
similar to the web page generation.  Also, 'show proof xxx
/lemmon/renumber' now matches the web page step numbers.  ('show proof
xxx/renumber' still has the indented form conforming to the actual RPN
proof, with slightly different numbering.)

<P>(9-Sep-2010) The metamath program (<A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/index.html#mmprog">version
0.07.51</A>) was updated with a modification by Stefan Allan that
adds hyperlinks the the Ref column of proofs.

<P>(12-Jun-2010) Scott Fenton contributed a D-proof (directly from
axioms) of Meredith's single axiom (see the end of <A

<P>(26-Jan-2010) Dmitri Vlasov writes, "I admire the simplicity and
power of the metamath language, but still I see its great disadvantage
- the proofs in metamath are completely non-manageable by humans without
proof assistants.  Therefore I decided to develop another language,
which would be a higher-level superstructure language towards metamath,
and which will support human-readable/writable proofs directly, without
proof assistants.  I call this language mdl (acronym for 'mathematics
development language')."  The latest version of Dmitri's translators from
metamath to mdl and back can be downloaded from <A
HREF="http://mathdevlanguage.sourceforge.net/">
http://mathdevlanguage.sourceforge.net/</A>.  Currently only Linux is
supported, but Dmitri says is should not be difficult to port it to
other platforms that have a g++ compiler.

<P>(11-May-2009) Stefan Allan modified the metamath program to add the
command "show statement xxx /mnemonics", which produces the output file
Mnemosyne.txt for use with the <A
HREF="http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/principles.php">Mnemosyne</A>
project.  The current <A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">Metamath program

Instructions:  Create the file mnemosyne.txt with e.g.  "show statement
ax-* /mnemonics".  In the Mnemosyne program, load the file by choosing
File->Import then file format "Q and A on separate lines".  Notes:  (1)
Don't
try to load all of set.mm, it will crash the program due to a bug
in Mnemosyne.  (2) On my computer, the arrows in ax-1 don't display.

which provides a "sandboxing" capability
for user theorems and dynamic update of
new theorems to the Metamath database
already loaded in memory by mmj2. Also, the
new "mmj2 Service" feature enables calling
mmj2 as a subroutine, or having mmj2 call

<P>(23-May-2008) G&eacute;rard Lang pointed me to Bob Solovay's note on
<A HREF="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2008-March/012783.html">AC
and strongly inaccessible cardinals</A>.  One of the eventual goals for
set.mm is to prove the Axiom of Choice from <A
HREF="mmset.html#groth">Grothendieck's axiom</A>, like Mizar does, and
this note may be helpful for anyone wanting to attempt that.
Separately, I also came across a <A
HREF="http://gamekid.undo.it/groth/">history of the size reduction of
grothprim</A> (viewable in Firefox and some versions of Internet
Explorer).

<P>(14-Apr-2008) A "/join" qualifier was added to the "search" command
in the metamath program (<A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/index.html#mmprog">version
0.07.37</A>).  This qualifier will join the $e hypotheses to the $a or
$p for searching, so that math tokens in the $e's can be matched as
well.  For example, "search *com* +v" produces no results, but "search
*com* +v /join" yields commutative laws involving vector addition.
Thanks to Stefan Allan for suggesting this idea.

<P>(9-Oct-2007) (From ocat):  The final 'beta' version of mmj2jar.zip
has been uploaded:  <A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/ocat/mmj2/mmj2jar.zip">mmj2jar.zip</A>,
<A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/ocat/mmj2/mmj2jar.md5">mmj2jar.md5</A>.
This version contains the following new feature (see the CHGLOG.TXT file
in the mmj2jar.zip download for complete list):
<PRE>
    6. Generates "info" message
       "I-PA-0119 Theorem xyz RPN-format Metamath proof generated!"
       when Ctrl-U (unification) is successful and the RPN-format
       proof is generated. Previously, no message was output. Also,
       positions to the last remaining (if any) incomplete proof
       step - or the 'qed' step if there are no incomplete proof
       steps and the cursor has not already been set.

       This modification allows a user to use a "dummy" 'qed'
       step and incrementally build a proof, with cursor
       positioning somewhere reasonable (a "dummy" incomplete
       proof step could be manually input for this purpose.)
       The new info message is intended to provide confirmation
       of the success of unification - which was previously
       provided by positioning the cursor at the end of the
       generated RPN-format proof.

<P>(1-Oct-2007) ocat has <A

here:  <A
HREF="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/ocat/mmj2/mmj2jar.zip">mmj2jar.zip</A>.)
The new automatic cursor positioning alone increased my proof entry
efficiency 1000%:  just type label, ctrl-u, label, ctrl-u,...  - no
mouse needed for those routine parts of the proof where you already know
what the steps are.  Plus, you can now just type "#syl.1" to reference a
hypothesis without having to scroll up to find the step number.  And,
there is automatic assignment of dummy vars and $d's at the end of a
proof.  I believe the program has now reached the critical mass needed
to make it a primary tool for proof entry.  Great job, ocat!

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "Unify+Get Hints" is quite
useful, and any proof can be generated as follows.  With "?" in the Hyp
field and Ref field blank, select "Unify+Get Hints".  Select a hint from
the list and put it in the Ref field.  Edit any $n dummy variables to
become the desired wffs.  Rinse and repeat for the new proof steps
generated, until the proof is done.

<!--
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may want to pick a reasonable
anchor point in "LOC_AFTER=" to establish context, so you don't end
up with transfinite cardinal theorems as hints for propositional
calculus proofs.
-->

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new tutorial, mmj2PATutorial.bat,
explains this in detail.  One way to reduce or avoid dummy $n's is to
fill in the Hyp field with a comma-separated list of any known
hypothesis matches to earlier proof steps, keeping a "?" in the list to
indicate that the remaining hypotheses are unknown.  Then "Unify+Get
Hints" can be applied.  The tutorial page
\mmj2\data\mmp\PATutorial\Page405.mmp has an example.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that the <A

<P>(29-Mar-2006) Mel O'Cat released a new version of the Proof Assistant
GUI for his <A
HREF="http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/mmj2">mmj2</A> proof
verifier for the Metamath language.  (He has been using it to help me

<P>(28-Mar-2006) Scott Fenton updated his second version of Metamath
Solitaire (the one that uses external axioms).  He writes:  "I've
switched to making it a standalone program, as it seems silly to have an
applet that can't be run in a web browser.  Check the README file for
further info."  The download is <A
HREF="../mmsolitaire/mmsol-0.5.tar.gz">mmsol-0.5.tar.gz</A>.

<P>(27-Mar-2006) Scott Fenton has updated the Metamath Solitaire Java
applet to Java 1.5:  (1) QSort has been stripped out:  its functionality
is in the Collections class that Sun ships; (2) all Vectors have been
replaced by ArrayLists; (3) generic types have been tossed in wherever
they fit:  this cuts back drastically on casting; and (4) any warnings
Eclipse spouted out have been dealt with.  I haven't yet updated it
officially, because I don't know if it will work with Microsoft's JVM in
older versions of Internet Explorer.  The current official version is
compiled with Java 1.3, because it won't work with Microsoft's JVM if it
is compiled with Java 1.4.  (As distasteful as that seems,
I will get complaints from users if it
doesn't work with Microsoft's JVM.)  If anyone can verify that Scott's new
version runs on Microsoft's JVM, I would be grateful.  Scott's new
version is <A HREF="../mmsolitaire/mm.java-1.5.gz">mm.java-1.5.gz</A>; after
uncompressing it, rename it to mm.java,
use it to replace the existing mm.java file in the
Metamath Solitaire download, and recompile according to instructions
in the mm.java comments.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scott has also created a second version, <A
HREF="../mmsolitaire/mmsol-0.2.tar.gz">mmsol-0.2.tar.gz</A>, that reads
the axioms from ASCII files, instead of having the axioms hard-coded in
the program.  This can be very useful if you want to play with custom
axioms, and you can also add a collection of starting theorems as
"axioms" to work from.  However, it must be run from the local directory
with appletviewer, since the default Java security model doesn't allow
reading files from a browser.  It works with the <A

<P>(20-Oct-2005) Juha Arpiainen is working on a proof verifier in Common
Lisp called <A
HREF="http://ranssi.paivola.net/~juhaarpi/bourbaki/">Bourbaki</A>.  Its
proof language has its roots in Metamath, with the goal of providing a
more powerful syntax and definitional soundness checking.  See its <A
HREF="http://ranssi.paivola.net/~juhaarpi/bourbaki/bourbaki_doc.pdf">
documentation</A> and related <A
HREF="http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Bourbaki_questions">

<P>(17-Oct-2005) Marnix Klooster has written a Metamath proof verifier in
Haskell, called <A
HREF="http://www.solcon.nl/mklooster/repos/hmm/">Hmm</A>.  Also see his
<A
HREF="http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/metamathCalculationalProofs">
Announcement</A>.  The complete program (Hmm.hs, HmmImpl.hs, and
HmmVerify.hs) has only 444 lines of code, excluding comments and blank
lines.  It verifies compressed as well as regular proofs; moreover, it
transparently verifies both per-spec compressed proofs and the
flawed format he uncovered (see comment below of 16-Oct-05).

<P>(16-Oct-2005) Marnix Klooster noticed that for large proofs, the
compressed proof format did not match the spec in the book.  His
algorithm to correct the problem has been put into the <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">Metamath program</A> (version 0.07.6).  The
program still verifies older proofs with the incorrect format, but the
user will be nagged to update them with 'save proof *'.  In set.mm, 285
out of 6376 proofs are affected.  (The incorrect format did not affect
proof correctness or verification, since the compression and
decompression algorithms matched each other.)

the qualifier "simple_tex" was added to the "show statement" command

<P>(30-Aug-2005) Mel O'Cat has written a new proof verifier for the
Metamath language, called <A
HREF="http://aux.planetmath.org/mmj2/mmj2.html">mmj2</A>.  Written in
Java, mmj2 meticulously enforces the strict Metamath spec and should
provide a "gold standard" for ensuring the absolute correctness of the
syntax and proofs in a Metamath database.  (As noted in the footnote on
p. 92 of the Metamath book, the current metamath program implements an
older, slightly looser syntax. Unlike other computer languages,
Metamath has evolved in "reverse" with its syntax simplified over time.
Updating the metamath program per the spec is on my to-do list.)
Together with Raph Levien's mmverify.py, there are now 3
independently-written proof verifiers.

<P>(3-Apr-2004) The <A HREF="../index.html#book"><I>Metamath</I>
book</A>'s Appendix C, "Metamath's Formal System," has (finally) been
corrected and added back in.  This appendix describes Metamath as an
abstract formal system.  It was removed about a year ago because it
contained an error.  Thanks to Prof. Robert Solovay
who found the error and suggested and reviewed the correction.

<P>(1-Apr-2004) (Actually added 26-May-04.)  For those people
<I>still</I> coming from <A
HREF="http://www.urgo.org/aprilfools.html">urgo.org</A> after all this
time, the April Fool's theorem
 (a real, if nonsensical and useless, theorem)
 is <A HREF="avril1.html">avril1</A>.

<P>(16-Apr-2004) I will not have access to my email server from 16-Apr-04
to 24-Apr-04, so do not expect a response during that time.

(1-Apr-2004) Theorem avril1 apparently achieved a short-term notoriety due
to its mention on http://www.waxy.org/archive/2004/04/01/internet.shtml .
For the non-mathematically inclined or otherwise confused, here is an
explanation:

  1. Poisson d'Avril is French for an "April Fish," which is what they
     call an April Fool.
  2. Poisson d'Avril is not to be confused with the mathematician
     responsible for the Poisson distribution.
  3. "Selbstdokumentieren" is the German word for "self-documenting".
     Pretentious German words such as "Aussonderung" are often used in set
     theory.
  4. "Literally" is quite literally redundant but adds to the
     pretentiousness.
  5. Loof Lirpa is April Fool spelt backwards.
  6. The theorem's label is "April 1" in French, but the unsuspecting
     might think it's the first in a series of theorems by d'Avril.
  7. The theorem itself says "April Fool" in leetspeak.
  8. Yes, the theorem really is a perfectly valid mathematical theorem,
     as its proof clearly shows.  The proof would have 6052749 primitive
     steps (as shown by the Metamath program's "show trace/count/essential"
     command) if expanded fully in terms of axioms only.

<P>(1-Mar-2004) In response to several people who have asked, I improved
the explanation of our unusual Axiom of Choice
in the comment for <A HREF="ac3.html">ac3</A>, so that hopefully you
should finally be able to understand it now.

<P>(4-Feb-2004) As an experiment, proof steps have been indented to see
if this helps better visualize their tree structure.

[I tried to add indentation in a way that is unobtrusive and does not
cause excessive line wrapping in proofs with deep nesting such as <A
HREF="fiint.html">fiint</A>.  The indentation step size may seem small
compared to what you are used to in a computer program, but computer
programs rarely have more than 4 or 5 levels of nesting whereas our
proofs have up to 50 levels and more.]

<P>(1-Feb-2004) Trivia:  In Jan. 2004, this site had 5500 visitors,
including visitors from over 300 <A HREF="../edu.html">colleges and
universities</A>.

<P>(30-Jan-2004) The rainbow-like color scheme of the little statement
numbers seems to be useful, so I will probably use it from now on.

If
you have a comment let me know at <FONT COLOR=BLUE>nm at alum dot
mit dot edu</FONT>.

<P>(11-Jan-2004) The color of the little statement number, that used
to be pink like <SPAN CLASS=p>3247</SPAN>, now varies
according to the theorem's position in the database.  This is an
experiment to see if it helps provide better visual hints when studying
proofs.  Read the <A HREF="#color">comments</A> so far and let me
know what you think.

<P>(11-Jan-2004) The theorems of Jan. 8, 9, 10, and 11 are not really
"new" but are revisions of older theorems as part of a database cleanup.

<P>(1-Jan-2004) Released the Metamath databases to <A
HREF="../copyright.html">public domain</A>.

<P>(14-Dec-2003) Added note on <A
HREF="../qlegif/mmql.html#prop">Kalmbach's axiom system for quantum
propositional calculus</A> in the Quantum Logic Explorer.


<P>(8-Dec-2003) Added <A HREF="df-map.html">df-map</A>.

<P>(4-Dec-2003) New format for the <A HREF="mmtheorems.html">Theorem
