David A. Wheeler has prepared an excellent 14-minute YouTube video,
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WH4Rd4UKGE">Metamath Proof Explorer:

<P>
Inspired by Whitehead and Russell's monumental <I>Principia Mathematica</I>,
<!--(where 1+1=2 is finally proved on page 86 of Volume II), -->
the Metamath Proof Explorer has over 23,000 completely worked out proofs,
starting from the very foundation that mathematics is built on and eventually
arriving at familiar mathematical facts and beyond.
<!-- in logic and set theory. -->
<!-- , interconnected with over a million hyperlinked cross-references. -->
Each proof is pieced together with razor-sharp precision using a simple
substitution rule that practically anyone (with lots of patience) can follow,
not just mathematicians.  Every step can be drilled down deeper and deeper into
the labyrinth until axioms of logic and set theory&mdash;the starting point for
all of mathematics&mdash;will ultimately be found at the bottom.  You could
spend literally days exploring the astonishing tangle of logic leading, say,
from the seemingly mundane theorem <A HREF="#trivia">2+2=4</A> back to these
axioms.
</P>

<P>
Essentially everything that is possible to know in mathematics can be derived
from a handful of axioms known as <I>Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory,</I> which is
the culmination of many years of effort to isolate the essential nature of
mathematics and is one of the most profound achievements of mankind.
</P>

<P>
The Metamath Proof Explorer starts with these axioms to build up its proofs.
There may be symbols that are unfamiliar to you, but we show in detail how they
are manipulated in the proofs, and in principle you don't have to know what
they mean.  In fact, there is a philosophy called <I>formalism</I> which says
that mathematics is a game of symbols with no intrinsic meaning.  With that in
mind, Metamath lets you watch the game being played and the pieces manipulated
according to simple and precise rules, one step at a time.
<!-- Amazingly, the rules - with which essentially all of mathematics can be
derived - are simpler than those involved in a game of chess! -->
</P>

<P>
As humans, we observe interesting patterns in these "meaningless" symbol
strings as they evolve from the axioms, and we attach meaning to them.  One
result is the set of natural numbers, whose properties match those we observe
when we count everyday objects, and their extensions to rational and real
numbers.  Of course, numbers were discovered centuries before set theory, and
historically they were "reversed engineered" back to the axioms of set theory.
The proof of <A HREF="#trivia">2 + 2 = 4</A> shows what was involved in that
reverse engineering, representing the work of many mathematicians from Dedekind
to von Neumann.  At the other extreme of abstraction is the theory of infinite
sets or transfinite cardinal numbers.  Some of the world's most brilliant
mathematicians have given us deep insight into this mysterious and wondrous
universe, which is sometimes called "Cantor's paradise."
</P>

mysterious and wondrous universe that, so far as we know, exists only in the
mind.
-->
<!--
that transcends the physical universe, giving us a glimpse into a higher
reality, perhaps even the mind of God.
-->

<P>
Metamath's formal proofs are much more detailed than the proofs you see in
textbooks.  They are broken down into the most explicit detail possible so that
you can see exactly what is going on.  Each proof step represents a microscopic
increment towards the final goal.  But each step is derived from previous ones
with a very simple rule, and you can verify for yourself the correctness of any
proof with very little skill.  All you need is patience.  With no prior
knowledge of advanced mathematics or even any mathematics at all, you can jump
into the middle of any proof, from the most elementary to the most advanced,
and understand immediately how the symbols were mechanically manipulated to go
from one proof step to another, even if you don't know what the symbols
themselves mean.  In the next section we show you how.

[If you are a math novice (or not) and have trouble understanding this section,
<A HREF="../email.html">let me know</A> what you find confusing so that I can
try to improve it.  An important point sometimes misunderstood is that Metamath
is <I>not</I> a theorem prover&mdash;it does not find these proofs on its own
but just verifies the correctness of proofs provided to it by its users.]
</FONT>
-->

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">What you need to know</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The only rule you need to know in order to follow the symbol manipulations in a
Metamath proof is <B>substitution</B>.  Substitution consists of replacing the
symbols for variables with expressions representing special cases of those
variables.  For example, in high-school algebra you learned that
<I>a</I> + <I>b</I> = <I>b</I> + <I>a</I>, where <I>a</I> and <I>b</I> are
variables (placeholders for numbers).  Two substitution instances of this law
are 5 + 3 = 3 + 5 and (<I>x</I> - 7) + <I>c</I> = <I>c</I> + (<I>x</I> - 7).
That's the only mathematical concept you need!
<!-- And if you don't know it, reread this paragraph until you do! -->
Substitution is just writing down a specific example
<!-- or a specialized version --> of a more general formula.
</P>

<!--
<B>Exercise:</B> How do we avoid confusion due to the fact that the
<I>b</I> in the second substitution instance also occurs in the original
formula?  <B>Answer:</B> Rename the <I>b</I> of the original formula to
some other variable, say <I>d</I>, giving us <I>a</I> + <I>d</I> =
<I>d</I> + <I>a</I>.  Then we replace the two occurrences of <I>a</I>
with (<I>b</I> - 7) and the two occurrences of <I>d</I> with <I>c</I>,
yielding the final answer (<I>b</I> - 7) + <I>c</I> = <I>c</I> +
(<I>b</I> - 7).
-->

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
[Note for logicians:  The substitution in Metamath proofs is, indeed, simply
the direct replacement of a variable with an expression.  The more complex
proper substitution of <A HREF="#traditional">traditional logic</A> is a
derived concept in Metamath, broken down into multiple primitive steps.
<A HREF="#distinct">Distinct variable</A> provisos, which accompany certain
axioms and are inherited by theorems, forbid unsound substitutions.]

<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">How it works</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To show you how this works in Metamath, we will break down and analyze a proof
step in the proof of 2 + 2 = 4. Once you grasp this example, you will
immediately be able to verify for yourself <I>any</I> proof in the
database&mdash;no further prerequisites are needed.  You may not understand
what all (or any) of the symbols mean, but you can follow the rules for how
they are manipulated, like game pieces, to prove theorems.

proofs will omit many details, implicitly assuming you have a deep
knowledge of prior material.  If you want to be a mathematician, you
will still need those years of study to achieve a high-level
understanding.  Metamath will not provide you with that.  But if you
just want the ability to convince yourself that a string of math symbols
that mathematicians call a "theorem" is a mechanical consequence of the axioms,
Metamath's proof method lets you accomplish that.
</P>

<P>
Metamath's conceptual simplicity has a tradeoff, which is the often
large number of steps needed for a complete proof all the way back to
the axioms.  But the proofs have been computer-verified, and you can
choose to study only the steps that interest you and still have complete
confidence that the rest are correct.

Step 2 of the 2p2e4 proof references step 1, which in turn "feeds" the
hypothesis of earlier theorem oveq2i (which used to be called opreq2i).  The
conclusion (assertion) of oveq2i then generates step 2 of 2p2e4.  Carefully
note the substitutions (lassoed in thin orange lines) that take place.

In the figure above we show part of the proof of the theorem 2 + 2 = 4, called
~ 2p2e4 in the database.  We will show how we arrived at proof step 2, which is
an intermediate result stating that (2 + 2) = (2 + (1 + 1)).  (This figure is
from an older version of this site that didn't show indentation levels, and it
is less cluttered for the purpose of this tutorial.  The indentation levels and
the <A HREF="../index.html#pink">little <!-- pink --> colored numbers</A> can
make a higher-level view of the proof easier to grasp.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;
Look at Step 2 of the proof.
In the Ref column, we see that it references a previously proved theorem,
~ oveq2i .  The theorem oveq2i requires a
hypothesis, and in the Hyp column of Step 2 we indicate that Step 1 will
satisfy (match) this hypothesis.
</P>

<P>
<IMG SRC='_orange2circ.gif' WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=19 ALT='(2)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
We make substitutions into the variables of the hypothesis of ~ oveq2i so that
it matches the string of symbols in the Expression column for Step 1.  To
achieve this, we substitute the expression "2" for variable ` A ` and the
expression "(1 + 1)" for variable ` B ` .  The middle symbol in the hypothesis
of ~ oveq2i is "=", which is a constant, and we are not allowed to substitute
anything for a constant.  Constants must match exactly.
</P>

<P>
Variables are always colored, and constants are always black (except the gray
turnstile ` |- ` , which you may ignore).  This makes them easy to recognize.
<!--
The variables in our database have 3 possible colors, <FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT>, and <FONT
COLOR="#CC33CC">purple</FONT>, representing wffs, sets, and classes
respectively.  Don't worry about what these terms mean right now.  All
variables, regardless of color, follow the same substitution rule.
-->
In our example, the purple uppercase italic letters are variables, whereas the
symbols "(", ")", "1", "2", "=", and "+" are constants.
</P>

<P>
In this example, the constants are probably familiar symbols.  In other cases
they may not be.  You should focus only on whether the symbols are variables or
constants, not on what they "mean."  Your only goal is to determine what
substitutions into the variables of the referenced theorem are needed to make
the symbol strings match.
</P>

<P>
<IMG SRC='_orange3circ.gif' WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=19 ALT='(3)'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Expression column of the Assertion box of ~ oveq2i , there are four
variables, ` A ` , ` B ` , ` C ` , and ` F ` .  Because we have already made
substitutions into the hypothesis, variables ` A ` and ` B ` have been
committed to the assignments "2" and "(1 + 1)" respectively, and we can't
change these assignments.  However, the new variables ` C ` and ` F ` are free
to be assigned with any expression we want (subject to the legal syntax
requirement described below).  By substituting "2" for ` C ` and "+" for
` F ` , we end up with (2 + 2) = (2 + (1 + 1)) that we show in the Expression
column for Step 2 of the proof of ~ 2p2e4 .
</P>

[It may seem peculiar to substitute a + sign for a variable, because you
wouldn't do that in high-school algebra.  We can do this because the variables
represent arbitrary objects called "classes," not just numbers.  See the
description for operation value ~ df-ov (don't worry about right-hand side of
the definition, for now).  A number and a + sign are both classes.  You have to
free your mind to forget about high-school algebra&mdash;pretend you have no
idea what a number or "+" is&mdash;and just look at what happens to the
symbols, independent of any meaning.  In fact (and ironically), it may be
better to look at a proof where all the symbols are unfamiliar, perhaps
~ aleph1re , so that you can observe the mechanical symbol substitutions
without the distraction of preconceived notions.]
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
When we first created the proof, why did we choose these particular
substitutions for ` C ` and ` F `?
The reason is simple&mdash;they make the proof work!  But how did we know
these particular substitutions should be picked, and not others?  That's
the hard part&mdash;we didn't know, nor did we know that oveq2i should be
referenced in the second proof step, nor did we know that Step 1 would
have the right expression to match the hypothesis of oveq2i.  The
choices were made using intelligent guesses, that were then verified to
work.  This is a skill a mathematician develops with experience.  Some
of the proofs in our database were discovered by famous mathematicians.
The Metamath Proof Explorer recaptures their efforts and shows you in
complete detail the proof steps and substitutions already worked out.
This allows you to follow a proof even if you are not a mathematician,
and be convinced that its conclusion is a consequence of the axioms.

<LI>Substitutions are simultaneous.  In other words each occurrence of a
given variable in a referenced theorem must be replaced with the same
expression.  For example, there are two occurrences of ` F `
in the Assertion of oveq2i, and both occurrences must be replaced with
the same expression, which is "+" in the above example.
</LI>

<LI>Substitutions are made into the variables of the referenced theorem
only, never into the variables of any proof step referenced
in the Hyp column (of the theorem being proved).  <I>In other words you
should pretend that all variables in the theorem being proved are
constants for the purpose of figuring out the substitutions.</I> You can
see this by looking at examples such as theorem ~ idALT .  To follow the proof
of ~ idALT , you should treat the symbol ` ph ` as if it were a
constant symbol, when you are figuring out the substitutions to make
into the variables of the referenced theorems (or axioms).
</LI>

<LI>If the variables of a referenced theorem (or axiom) happen to have
the same names as those in the theorem being proved, you may want to
temporarily rename the variables in the referenced theorem (or axiom)
before substituting expressions for them, to avoid confusion.  For
example, the proof of ~ idALT will be less confusing if the occurrences of
` ph ` in the referenced axioms are renamed to something else.
Specifically, you can rewrite ~ ax-1 as, say, ` ( ch -> ( ps -> ch ) ) ` .
Then, to obtain step 2 of the proof of ~ idALT , substitute "` ph `" for ` ch `
and "` ( ph -> ph ) `" for ` ps ` .

<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Legal syntax</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is a further requirement for Metamath substitutions we have not described
yet.  You can't substitute just any old string of symbols for a purple
class variable.  Instead, the symbol string must qualify as a class
expression.  For example, it would be illegal to substitute the
nonsensical "(1 +" for variable ` B ` above.  However, "(1 + 1)" is legal.
Here is how you can tell.  "1" is a legal class by ~ c1 .  "+" is a
legal class by ~ caddc .  Then, by making these
class substitutions into the class variables of ~ co , we see that "(1 + 1)"
is a legal class.  But there is no such construction that would let us show
that the nonsensical "(1 +" is a legal class.
</P>

<!--
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">[On the other hand, the fact that 1 and + are both
classes means we are allowed to substitute them for any class variables
at all, even where they normally wouldn't go.  For example, it is legal
to substitute + for <I><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">C</FONT></I> and 1 for
<I><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">F</FONT></I> in oveq2i above, resulting in the
seemingly nonsensical ( + 1 2 ) = ( + 1 ( 1 + 1 ) ). Believe it or not,
this is a perfectly valid theorem of set theory!  However, it jumps out
of the subtheory of arithmetic and is of little use; it certainly
doesn't help us make progress towards a proof of ( 2 + 2 ) = 4.
-->
<!--
If this bothers
you, consider the following analogy:  any random collection of syntactically
legal statements in a computer language constitute a valid program,
even though the program would be of little use.
-->
<!--
We can play around with such ideas for fun to prove silly but still
perfectly valid theorems
like ~ avril1 , which if nothing else provides an
interesting exercise for figuring out the substitutions involved in its
proof.]</FONT>
</P>
-->

<P>
Similarly, blue wff variables and red setvar variables can be substituted only
with expressions that qualify as those types.
</P>

<P>
In other words, we must "prove" that any expression we want to substitute for a
variable qualifies as a legal expression for that type of variable, before we
are allowed to make the substitution.  This also states precisely what is being
substituted, preventing any ambiguity.
</P>

<P>
The actual proofs stored in the database have additional steps that construct,
from syntax definitions, the expressions that are substituted for variables.
We suppress these construction steps on the web pages because they would make
the proofs very long and tedious.  However, the syntax breakdown is
straightforward to check by hand if you make use of the "Syntax hints" provided
with each proof.  Once you get used to the syntax, you should be able to "see"
its breakdown in your head; in the meantime you can trust that the Metamath
proof verifier did its job.
</P>

<P>
If you want to see for yourself the hidden steps that construct the variable
substitutions for each proof step, you can display them using the Metamath
program.  For the proof above, use the commands "save proof 2p2e4 /normal"
followed by "show proof 2p2e4 /all" in the Metamath program.  (Follow the
instructions for downloading and running the
<A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">Metamath program</A>.  Try it, it's easy!)
In the "/all" proof display, you will see that step 21 corresponds to step 2 of
the figure above.  Steps 14-17 are the hidden steps showing that "(1 + 1)" is a
legal class as we described above.  To see the substitutions we talked about
for step 2, you can type "show proof 2p2e4 /detailed_step 21".
</P>

<P>
This is a general property of Metamath, not just of the set.mm database.
For example, step 32 of proof <tt>th1</tt> in demo database <tt>demo0.mm</tt>
must match two expressions to use theorem <tt>mp</tt>:
<UL>
<LI> ` |- ( P -> Q ) `
<LI> ` |- ( ( t + 0 ) = t -> ( ( t + 0 ) = t -> t = t ) ) `
</UL>

This could be matched many different expressions, for example:
<UL>
<LI> `P` := ` ( t + 0 ) = t `
<LI> `Q` := ` ( ( t + 0 ) = t -> t = t ) `
</UL>

or

<UL>
<LI> ` P ` := ` ( t + 0 ) = t -> ( ( t + 0 ) = t `
<LI> ` Q ` := ` t = t )`
</UL>
<!--- 4-Aug-2021 nm </P> here causes http://validator.w3.org failure -->

<P>
However, theorem <tt>mp</tt> in database <tt>demo0.mm</tt> actually has four
arguments (which you can see if you ask metamath.exe to show them).  The first
two are the substitutions, which are usually suppressed.  That is, you first
have to prove ` wff P ` , then ` wff Q ` , then ` |- P ` , then
` |- ( P -> Q  ) ` , and then theorem mp applies to derive ` |- Q ` .  If you
use metamath.exe, "show proof th1" will list only 5 steps, but with suspicious
gaps in the numbering; "show proof th1 /all" will show all the substitution
steps (which in fact make up the majority of the actual proof on disk).
</P>

<P>
A proof of ` wff P ` is equivalent to a proof that ` P ` is a well-formed
formula, and it is this that prevents invalid substitutions like
` Q ` := ` t = t ) ` ; you will not be able to prove ` wff t = t ) ` so that
proof will not work. But in any case the Metamath verifier isn't being asked to
come up with the substitution (although most metamath proof assistants will,
using unification), so no matching algorithm is necessary, only a substitution
and an equality check.
</P>

<P>
In the case of axioms and definitions, we <I>do</I> show their detailed syntax
breakdown, because there is free space on those web pages not used for anything
else.  These can help you become familiar with the syntax.  For example, look
at the <tt>set.mm</tt> (Metamath Proof Explorer) definition of the number 2,
~ df-2 .  You can see, at Step 4, the demonstration that ` ( 1 + 1 ) ` is a
legal expression that qualifies as a class, i.e. that can be substituted for a
purple class variable.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Distinct variable restrictions</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our final requirement for substitutions is described in
<A HREF="#distinct">Appendix 3:  Distinct Variables</A> below.  These
restrictions have no effect on how you figure out the the substitutions that
were made in a proof step.  All they do is prohibit certain substitutions that
would otherwise be legal based what we have described so far.  Eventually you
should learn how they work in order to complete your understanding of the
mechanics of logic, but for now, you can trust that the Metamath proof verifier
has ensured that they have been met.

An <B>axiom</B> is a fundamental assumption that provides a starting point for
reasoning.  The axioms for (essentially) all of mathematics can be conveniently
divided into three groups:  <B>propositional calculus,</B> <B>predicate
calculus,</B> and <B>set theory</B>.  Each axiom is a string of mathematical
symbols of two kinds:  <B>constants</B>, also called <B>connectives</B>, which
we show in black; and <B>variables</B>, which we show in color.  The constants
that occur in the axioms are ` ( ` , ` ) ` , ` -> ` , ` -. ` , ` = ` , ` e. ` ,
and ` A. ` (left parenthesis, right parenthesis, implies, not, equals, is a
member of, for all).
</P>

<P>
Variables are placeholders that can be substituted with other expressions
(strings of symbols).  There are two kinds of variables in the axioms,
<B>setvar variables</B> (lowercase italic letters in
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">red</FONT>) and <B>wff ("well-formed formula")
variables</B> (lowercase Greek letters in
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>).  A wff variable can be substituted with any
expression qualifying as a wff (see below).  A setvar variable can be
substituted only with another setvar variable (in other words with an
expression of length one, whose only symbol is a setvar variable) since there
are no rules that let us construct more complex expressions for them.  We call
these "setvar variables" rather than just "set variables" to emphasize this
restriction.  The reason for this restriction is that they often serve as bound
or dummy variables in expressions, i.e. the first argument of the ` A. `
quantifier connective introduced below.  It is the same reason that you cannot
substitute say 2 for x in "the integral of x dx" to result in "the integral of
2 d2", which would be nonsense.
</P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
[In later proofs you will see a third kind of variable, called a <B>class
variable</B>, which is shown in <FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">purple</FONT> (usually as
uppercase italic letters) and is a kind of generalization of the setvar
variable that can be substituted with expressions such as 2 or ` ( _pi + 3 ) `.
The <A HREF="#class">theory of classes</A> will be discussed in the next
section.]

Following the tradition in the literature, we use italic Greek letters for wff
variables and lower-case italic letters for setvar variables.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
[If you use a monochrome display or printout, or are colorblind, the red
variables are lowercase italic letters, the purple ones uppercase italic, and
the blue ones italic Greek.   Sometimes we use mathematical symbols (such as +)
as class variables, and in that case they are distinguished by both the purple
color and a dotted underline.  In all cases, the colors are not necessary to
disambiguate the symbols.  You can see the list of all symbols including
variables on the <A HREF="mmascii.html">ASCII Symbol Equivalents</A> page.]

Any mathematical object whatsoever, such as the number 2, the operation of
taking a square root, or the surface of a sphere, is considered to be a
<B>set</B> in set theory.  The red setvar variables represent arbitrary sets
such as these. (You can't substitute the expressions for these sets directly
into the setvars, as discussed above, but must use the setvars as part of a
formula that specifies the properties of these sets indirectly.  Our theory of
classes in the next section makes direct substitutions possible, giving us an
often more convenient mechanism for practical work.)

<I>A set can be equal to another set, can be contained in another set, and can
contain other sets.</I>
<!-- ("Is contained in," "is a member of," "is an element of," and "belongs to"
mean the same thing.) -->
For example, the set of real numbers contains, of course, all of the real
numbers.  A specific real number such as 2 is also a set, but not in such a
familiar way&mdash;it contains a very complex construction of sets, a kind of
machine inside of it that causes it to behave according to the laws for real
numbers in the presence of the ZFC axioms.  The square root operation is a set
containing an infinite number of ordered pairs, one for each nonnegative real
number; the first member of each pair is the number and the second member its
square root.  (Recall that a setvar variable can only be replaced with another
setvar variable, so we cannot replace a setvar variable with say the symbol
"2".  Manipulation of such symbols uses the definitional mechanism we will
introduce in the <A HREF="#class">Theory of Classes</A> section below.)
</P>

<P>  <A NAME="wffsyntax"></A>
A <B>wff</B> is an expression (string of symbols) constructed as follows.  A
starting wff either is a wff variable, or it consists of two setvar variables
connected with either ` = ` ("equals," "is identical to") or ` e. ` ("is an
element of," "is a member of," "belongs to," "is contained in").  Two wffs may
be connected with ` -> ` ("implies," "only if") to form a new wff, with
parentheses around the result to prevent ambiguity.  A wff may be prefixed with
` -. ` ("not") to form a new wff.  And finally, a wff may be prefixed with
` A. ` ("for all," "for each," "for every") and a setvar variable to form a new
wff.
&nbsp;
<I>To summarize:</I>
If ` ph ` is a wff variable and ` x ` and ` y ` are setvar variables, then
` ph ` , ` x = y ` , and ` x e. y ` are (starting) wffs.  If ` ph ` and ` ps `
are wffs and ` x ` is a setvar variable, then ` ( ph -> ps ) ` , ` -. ph ` ,
and ` A. x ph ` are also wffs.
</P>

<P>
Note that a wff variable can be viewed as a wff in its own right as well as a
placeholder for which other wffs can be substituted.
</P>

<P>
The axioms below are examples of wffs.  Each page describing an axiom, for
example ~ ax-12 , presents the axiom's construction in a syntax breakdown
chart, showing that it follows these rules and is therefore a wff.  You may
want to look at a few of these to make sure you understand how wffs are
constructed and how to deconstruct, or parse, them into their components.
</P>

<!--
<P>Wffs constructed this way are, in principle, able to express all of
mathematics.  In practice it is inefficient, and as we develop
mathematics from the axioms we often introduce new symbols to abbreviate
(define) more complex expressions.  But these can always be broken down
into the form we just described.
-->

<P>
<I>Wffs are either true or false,</I> depending on what is assigned to the
variables they contain.  For example, the wff ` x = y ` is true if ` x ` and
` y ` stand for the same set and false otherwise&mdash;there is no in-between.
</P>

<P>
An <B>axiom</B> (example: ~ ax-1 ) is a wff that we postulate to be true no
matter what (within the constraints of the syntax rules) we substitute for its
variables.  An <B>inference rule</B> (example: ~ ax-mp ) consists of one or
more wffs called <B>hypotheses</B>, together with a wff called the
<B>conclusion</B> (which on our web pages with proofs we also call its
<B>assertion</B>) that we postulate to be true provided the hypotheses are
true.  A <B>proof</B> is a sequence of substitution instances of axioms and
inference rules, where the hypotheses of the inference rules match previous
steps in the sequence.  The last step in a proof is a <B>theorem</B> (example:
~ idALT ).  For brevity, a proof may also refer to earlier theorems (example:
~ id ), but in principle it can be expanded into references to only the initial
axioms and rules.
</P>

<P>
We also use the word "theorem" informally to denote the result of a proof that
also allows references to local hypotheses and thus has the form of an
inference rule (example: ~ a1i ); however, strictly speaking, such a theorem
should be called a <B>derived inference rule</B> or <B>deduction</B>.  In a
derived inference rule, a proof is a sequence steps each of which is a
substitution instance of an axiom, a hypothesis, or a substitution instance of
an inference rule applied to previous steps.  (Note that a proof with nothing
but references to hypotheses still qualifies as a proof, even though neither
axioms nor inference rules are involved.  For example, the unusual derived
inference rule ~ a1ii is proved before we even introduce the first axiom!)
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="scaxioms"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Propositional
calculus</FONT></B> deals with general truths about wffs regardless of how they
are constructed.  The simplest propositional truth is "` ( ph -> ` ` ph ) `",
which can be read "if something is true, then it is true"&mdash;rather trivial
and obvious, but nonetheless it must be proved from the axioms (see theorem
~ id ).  In an application of this truth, we could replace ` ph ` with a more
specific wff to give us, for example, "` ( x ` ` = ` ` y ` ` -> ` ` x ` ` = `
` y ) `".  (You might think that ~ id would be a useless bit of trivia, but in
fact it is frequently used.  For example, look at its use in the proof of the
law of assertion ~ pm2.27 .)

Our system of propositional calculus consists of three axioms and the modus
ponens inference rule.  It is attributed to Jan &#321;ukasiewicz (pronounced
<I>woo-kah-SHAY-vitch</I>) and was popularized by Alonzo Church, who called it
system P<SUB>2</SUB>.

The turnstile ` |- ` is a symbol (introduced by Frege in 1879) used in formal
logic to indicate that the wff that follows is provable (and is traditionally
used even for an axiom, which is "provable" in one step, itself); it can be
ignored for informal reading.  (Technically, the Metamath program needs an
initial token to disambiguate the kind of expression that follows.  I figured,
why not make it the turnstile that logic books use?  In the Quantum Logic
Explorer, on the other hand, I mapped it to a blank image because my physics
colleague didn't like it.)  The symbols ` & ` and ` => ` are used informally in
the table above to indicate the relationship between hypotheses and conclusion;
they are not part of the formal language.

<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Predicate calculus</FONT></B>
introduces three new symbols, ` = ` ("equals"), ` e. ` ("is
a member of"), and ` A. ` ("for all").  The first two are called "predicates."
A predicate specifies a true or false relationship between its two arguments.
As an example, ` x = x ` always evaluates to true regardless of what ` x ` is,
as the theorem ~ equid demonstrates.  The "for all" symbol, also called the
"universal quantifier," ranges over or "scans" all possible values of its first
(setvar variable) argument, applying them to the second (wff expression)
argument, and returns true if and only if the second argument is true for every
value of the first.  The wff ` A. x ph ` is read "for all x, it is the case
that phi is true."  The axioms of predicate calculus express the logical
properties of these new symbols that are universally true, independent from any
theory (like set theory) making use of them.  (What we call "setvar variables"
are more generally called "individual variables" in predicate calculus without
set theory.)

<P>
Our axiom system is closely related to a system of Tarski (see the
<A HREF="#axiomnote">note on the axioms</A> below).  Our system is exactly
equivalent to the <A HREF="#traditional">traditional</A> axiom system in most
logic textbooks but has the advantage of being easy to manipulate with a
computer program.  Each of our axioms corresponds to an
<A HREF="#schemes">axiom scheme</A> of the traditional system.

Axiom ~ ax-5 has a restriction on what substitutions we are allowed to make
into its variables.  This restriction is inherited by theorems that use this
axiom, according to the substitutions made in their proofs, and you will often
see <A HREF="#distinct">distinct variable</A> conditions associated with such
theorems.

The above table is divided into two groups, those from a system devised by
logician Alfred Tarski and some additional auxilliary axiom schemes.  The
latter, while logically redundant at the object language level, endow the the
system with a property called "scheme completeness", which means that any theorem (scheme) expressible in the <A
HREF="#wffsyntax">wff syntax</A> described above can be proved <I>directly</I>,
without having to resort to techniques like combining cases or induction on
formula length.  This is explained <A HREF="#compare">below</A>.
</P>

<P>
In December 2018, the axioms were renumbered and may not correspond to the
numbers in older papers, slide presentations, and websites.  See
<A HREF="#oldaxioms">Appendix 8</A> for details.

If we are willing to live without the concept of "a setvar variable not
occurring in a wff" (or wish to do so to simplify the metalogic), we can
omit axiom ~ ax-5 and still have a complete
system of logic.  However, ~ ax-5 provides us
with more general theorem <I>schemes</I> and can make proofs
considerably shorter.  Interestingly, if we include ~ ax-5 , then ~ ax-c14 and
~ ax-c16 become redundant (see ~ axc14 and ~ axc16 ).
</P>

<P>
To simplify the metalogic even further&mdash;with no restrictions on
substitutions at all&mdash;we can omit both ~ ax-c16
and ~ ax-5 , provided we are willing to live with
redundant "<A HREF="mmzfcnd.html#distinctors">distinctors</A>" that will
accumulate as antecedents of theorems.  Aside from this nuisance, we
would still have a complete system of logic, although it wouldn't be
a very practical one since its proofs tend be very long.

In principle it is possible to reformulate the axioms with ` e. ` as the only
connective, making the ` = ` connective redundant.  But actually coming up with
a nice set of Metamath-style axioms for this is an interesting <B>open
problem</B> (see Problem 13 on the <A HREF="../award2003.html">Workshop
Miscellany</A> page).  This problem basically involves refining and
simplifying a starting point that is already given (see me for details).
If you're interested, it would be a good way to become acquainted with
the axioms of logic while also producing something new that will live on
after you!

The quantifier prefix ` A. x ` means "for all sets ` x ` ."  For example, a
very obvious truth (whose proof is ~ ax-gen applied to ~ equid ) is
` A. x x = x ` which simply means "any set ` x ` is equal to itself."  On the
other hand it states something quite profound:  it literally means <I>any</I>
set ` x ` whatsover.  This includes all mathematical objects that have
ever been discovered and that ever will be discovered, from the empty
set containing nothing, to numbers so large that they can encode all of
human knowledge, to infinite sets of integers and real numbers up
through the largest uncountable infinities.  Think about it.

for our purposes, you can just <I>assume that</I> ~ df-bi , ~ df-an ,
<I>and</I> ~df-ex <I>are additional axioms</I> (which they are in some
axiomatizations of logic) so that you don't have to be concerned with their

construction rules are extended with ~ wb , ~ wa , and ~ wex .  Alternately,
you can rewrite the set theory axioms below with these three definitions

<A NAME="staxioms"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Set theory</FONT></B> uses the
formalism of propositional and predicate calculus to assert properties of
arbitrary mathematical objects called "sets."  A set can be an element of
another set, and this relationship is indicated by the ` e. ` symbol.  Starting
with the simplest mathematical object, called the empty set, set theory builds
up more and more complex structures whose existence follows from the axioms,
eventually resulting in extremely complicated sets that we identify with the
real numbers and other familiar mathematical objects.  These axioms were
developed in response to <A HREF="ru.html">Russell's Paradox</A>, a discovery
that revolutionized the foundations of mathematics and logic.
</P>

<P>
Except for Extensionality, the axioms basically say, "given an arbitrary set
` x ` (and, in the cases of Replacement and Regularity, provided that an
antecedent is satisfied), there exists another set ` y ` based on or
constructed from it, with the stated properties."  (The axiom of Extensionality
can also be restated this way as shown by ~ axext2 .)  The individual axiom
links provide more detailed descriptions.  We derive the redundant ZF axioms of
<A HREF="axsep.html">Separation</A>, <A HREF="axnul.html">Null Set</A>, and

restrictions on the variables that may occur in wff ` ph ` below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Above we qualified the phrase "all of mathematics" with "essentially."  The
main important missing piece is the ability to do category theory, which
requires huge sets (inaccessible cardinals) larger than those postulated by the
ZFC axioms.  The Tarski&ndash;Grothendieck Axiom postulates the existence of
such sets.  We have included it in a separate table below for two reasons:
first, it is not normally considered to be part of ZFC set theory, and second,
unlike the ZFC axioms, it is not "elementary," in that the known forms of it
are very long when expanded to set theory primitives.  Below we show it
compacted with definitions.  Theorem ~ grothprim shows you what it looks like
when the definitions are expanded into the primitives used by the other axioms.
The Tarski-Grothendieck axiom can be viewed as a very strong replacement of
the Axiom of Infinity and implies that axiom (theorem ~ grothomex ) as well as
the Axiom of Choice (theorem ~ grothac ) and the Axiom of Power Sets (theorem
~ grothpw ).

What else is missing from our axioms?  G&ouml;del showed that no finite set of
axioms or axiom schemes can completely describe any consistent theory strong
enough to include arithmetic.  But practically speaking, the ones above are the
accepted foundation that almost all mathematicians explicitly or implicitly
base their work on.
</P>

<P>
Set theorists often study the consequences of additional axioms that assert,
for example, the existence of larger and larger infinities beyond those
postulated by ZFC or even the Tarski&ndash;Grothendieck Axiom, to the point of
flirting with inconsistency (although G&ouml;del also showed that we can never
know whether even the ZFC axioms are consistent).  While this work is certainly
profound and important, these axioms are not ordinarily used outside of set
theory.  To study such an additional axiom with Metamath, we can assert it as a
new axiom, or alternately we can simply state it as a hypothesis to any theorem
making use of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In <A HREF="#figure1">Figure 1</A> above that shows part of the proof of 2+2=4,
there are some purple-colored variables such as ` A ` and ` B ` that do not
appear in any of the axioms of logic and set theory that we just presented.
Even the number 2 is a symbol (a constant) that we cannot manipulate with the
axioms, because of the rule that only setvar variables (and not constants or
other expressions) can be substituted for setvar variables.  You may at this
point feel lost, wondering how our introductory 2+2=4 example bears any
relationship at all to the axioms!  In this section, we will discuss how this
notation ties into our axioms and how to convert it to the primitive or basic
language used by the axioms.
<!--- 4-Aug-2021 nm </P> here causes http://validator.w3.org failure -->

<P>
In principle, mathematics can be done using only the setvar and wff variables
that appear in the axioms.  But the notation can be awkward to work with and is
not always intuitive for humans.  To make mathematics more practical, we extend
the set theory language with a definitional notation called the <B>theory of
classes</B>.  An expression of the form ` { x | ph } ` , where ` x ` is any
setvar variable and ` ph ` is any wff, is interchangeably called a <B>class
builder</B>, <B>class abstract[ion]</B>, <B>class term</B>, or <B>class
comprehension</B> by different authors.  We call an object that can be
represented in this form a <B>class</B> and read ` { x | ph } ` as "the class
of all ` x ` such that ` ph ` holds".  Every class is a (possibly empty)
collection of sets, although not every such collection is itself a set (see the
discussion for theorem ~ ru ).  For example, ` { x | ( x e. ZZ /\ 2 < x ) } `
is the class (and also set) of all integers greater than 2.
</P>

<P>
We use upper-case variables ` A ` , ` B ` ,... to range over class builders and
call them <B>class variables</B>.  More generally, we let them range over any
object representing a class, such as other class variables.  (A class variable
` A `  itself can be represented with the class builder ` { x | x e. A } ` and
thus qualifies as a class; see theorem ~ abid2 .)  Our language will now have
three kinds of variables: ` ph ` , ` ps ` ,... ranging over wffs, ` x ` ,
` y ` ,... ranging over setvars, and ` A ` , ` B ` ,... ranging over classes.
</P>

<P>
In the basic language, the ` e. ` and ` = ` connectives must connect two setvar
variables, so all starting wffs (without wff variables) are of the form
` x e. y ` and ` x ` ` = y ` .  We extend the language syntax, i.e. the
definition of a wff, by allowing ` e. ` and ` = ` to connect two expressions
representing classes, as exemplified in the three definitions below.  Theorems
involving the extended syntax are derived making use of those three
definitions.
</P>

<P>
We can construct new classes from existing ones, a property we often exploit to
define new concepts.  For example, we introduce the symbol ` u. ` and define
the <B>union</B> of two classes ` A ` and ` B ` in ~ df-un :
 ` ( A u. ` ` B ) = { x | ( x e. A \/ x e. B ) } ` .
<!--
Without class variables, we should define the union of ` { y | ph } ` and
` { y | ps } ` as ` ( { y | ph } u. { y | ps } ) = { x | ( x e. { y | ph } \/ `
` x e. { y | ps } ) } ` .  This form is rather awkward, and in practice
we use class variables and ~ df-un .
-->
Here the defined expression on the left of the "=" abbreviates the expression
on the right.  When eliminating the defined expression, we can choose for ` x `
any variable not occurring in ` A ` or ` B ` (theorem ~ unjust ); it is a
bound or dummy variable similar to the <I>x</I> in the integral from 0 to 1 of
<I>x</I>&nbsp;d<I>x</I>.  By introducing this definition, we effectively extend
the syntax with new class expressions of the form ` ( A u. B ) ` that can be
substituted for class variables.
<!--
Since such a defined expression can obviously be eliminated (and is verified by
the mmj2 program to be sure), such an extension does not strengthen the system
with the definition eliminated.
-->
</P>

<P>
The number 2 in <A HREF="#figure1">Figure 1</A> is another example of a defined
class builder, in this case a constant with no arguments.  Our definition
~ df-2 , 2 = ` ( 1 + 1 ) ` , involves yet more defined class constants (` 1 `
defined in ~ df-1 and ` + ` defined in ~ df-add ), so it is not obviously a
class builder at this point.  But if we backtrack far enough through several
definitions, we will eventually end up with 2 = ` { x | ` ...` } ` where "..."
is a wff in the extended language.
</P>

<P>
We still need to determine what the above examples correspond to in the basic
language used by the axioms.  In essence, there is an algorithm to translate
each wff containing class builders to a unique equivalent wff in the basic
language of predicate calculus used for set theory.  Later in this section, we
will show an example using the algorithm to provide a feel for how to recover
the basic language from a wff in the extended language.
</P>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">The class definitions</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The algorithm for eliminating class builders is accomplished using the
following three definitions, which in effect provide the recursive definition
of wffs containing class builders.

<P>
Definition ~ df-clab extends the ` e. ` connective, and thus the definition of
a wff, to allow a class builder on the right-hand side of the ` e. `
connective, instead of (previously) only setvar variables on each side.  Note
that the ` ph ` in ~ df-clab is a wff in the extended language and thus may
itself contain class builders.  The proper substitution denoted by
` [ x / y ] ph ` has been previously defined by ~ df-sb .
</P>

<P>
Definition ~ df-cleq extends the ` = ` connective to allow classes on both
sides.  The definition itself has a hypothesis, and above we show the derived
version ~ dfcleq with the hypothesis eliminated for practical use.  Without its
hypothesis, ~ df-cleq would produce the axiom of extensionality ~ ax-ext as a
special case and thus is not sound (is not conservative) in the context of
predicate calculus without set theory.  If we assume our class theory
definitionally extends set theory rather than just predicate calculus, the
hypothesis is unnecessary and merely provides us with a somewhat nitpicking
isolation from set theory.  Most authors do not include this hypothesis.  An
advantage of the hypothesis for us is that we must explicitly use ~ ax-ext to
satisfy it as in theorem ~ dfcleq , meaning we can more easily determine
exactly where ~ ax-ext was used by a proof.
</P>

<P>
Definition ~ df-clel similarly extends the ` e. ` connective to allow classes
on both sides.  We do not need a hypothesis as we did for ~ df-cleq because its
instances are theorems of predicate calculus (see theorem ~ cleljust ).
</P>

<P>
As an important special case, a setvar variable ` x ` can be considered a class
because it equals the class builder ` { y | y e. x } ` (theorem ~ cvjust ).
This is the justification for syntax builder ~ cv , which for convenience
allows us to substitute a setvar variable directly for a class variable.  (On
the other hand, we may not substitute a class variable for a setvar variable
directly.)
</P>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">An example</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To see an example of the algorithm, let us eliminate the class builder from the
(extended) wff ` { x | x = a } = b ` .  For simplicity we will assume all
setvar variable pairs are <A HREF="#distinct">distinct</A>.  Treating the
setvar variable ` b ` as a class and applying ~ dfcleq , we get
` A. y ( y e. { x | x = a } <-> y e. b ) ` .
Applying ~ df-clab , we get
` A. y ( [ y / x ] x = a <-> y e.  b ) ` .
Applying ~ df-sb , we get
` A. y ( ( x = y -> x = a ) /\ E. x ( x = y /\ x = a ) ) <-> y e. b ) ` ,
which is our final expression in the basic language of predicate calculus
(implicitly assuming we have expanded the defined connectives ` E. ` , ` /\ ` ,
` <-> `).  This expression is unique provided we have some canonical convention
for traversing the extended wff syntax tree and for naming any new variables
introduced at each step.  By the way, this can be simplified with additional
applications of predicate calculus to become ` A. y ( y = a <-> y e. b ) ` .
</P>

<!-- which we can also obtain immediately from the penultimate step by noticing
that the substitution ` [ y / x ] x = a ` evaluates to ` y = a ` . -->

<P>
Our example showed the elimination of class builders from a wff with
no class variables.  If the wff also contains class variables, these can
be converted to wff variables by substituting ` { x | ph } `
for ` A ` , ` { y | ps } ` for ` B ` ,
and so on, where ` ph ` and ` ps ` are new wff variables that don't occur in
the original extended wff.  The variables ` x ` and ` y ` are arbitrary (and
may be the same) as long as they don't conflict with any distinct variable
requirements imposed on ` A ` and ` B ` .  We then would
follow the procedure of the above example.  The description of theorem
~ abeq2 goes into more detail and gives some
actual database examples where this translation takes place.
</P>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Justification</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The theory of classes can be shown to be an eliminable and conservative
extension of set theory.
</P>

<!--
<B>Eliminable</B> means that each statement of
the extended language corresponds to (can be translated to) an
equivalent statement in the primitive language.  <B>Conservative</B>
means we cannot prove anything that, when translated to the primitive
language, could not be proved from the original set theory axioms (i.e.
it does not strengthen the system).
-->

The <B>eliminability</B> property shows that for every formula in the extended
language we can build a logically equivalent formula in the basic
language; so that even if the extended language provides more ease to
convey and formulate mathematical ideas for set theory, its expressive
power is not in fact stronger than the basic language's expressive
power.

The <B>conservation</B> property shows that for every proof of a formula of
the basic language in the extended system we can build another proof of
the same formula in the basic system; so that, concerning theorems on
sets only, the deductive powers of the extended system and of the basic
system are identical.

Together, these properties mean that the extended language can be treated as a
definitional extension that is <B>sound</B>.

<P>
A rigorous justification, which we will not give here, can be found in
[<A HREF="#Levy">Levy</A>] pp. 357-366, supplementing his informal introduction
to class theory on pp. 7-17.  Two other good treatments of class theory are
provided by [<A HREF="#Quine">Quine</A>] pp. 15-21 and
[<A HREF="#TakeutiZaring">TakeutiZaring</A>] pp. 10-14.  Quine's exposition is
nicely written and very readable.  Our purple class variables are Greek letters
in [Quine], and he uses an archaic dot notation instead of parentheses, but
this is a relatively minor hurdle especially since you can compare the Metamath
versions of many of the theorems.
</P>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">History</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to [<A HREF="#Levy">Levy</A>] (p. 11), the way we introduce classes
was first explicitly stated by [<A HREF="#Quine">Quine</A>] (1963), who built
on ideas stemming from Paul Bernays, particularly in Bernays' book <I>Axiomatic
Set Theory</I> (1958).  Quine uses the term "virtual classes" for the theory of
classes we use here.  Also according to Levy (pp. 11, 6, and 87), the informal
idea of using classes that cannot belong to other classes occurred to Cantor in
1899 after he became aware of the <A HREF="onprc.html">Burali-Forti paradox</A>
(1897) and the fact that Cantor's theorem <A HREF="ncanth.html">fails</A> for
the universe V (1899).  (<A HREF="ru.html">Russell's paradox</A> came later, in
1901.)  There are other (different) axiomatic set theories, including Russell's
theory of types, New Foundations, Quine's previous "Mathematical Logic" system,
and von Neumann-Bernays-G&ouml;del (NBG).  A more detailed comparison of ZFC
using Quine's virtual classes with these other axiomatic set theories can be
found in [<A HREF="#Quine">Quine</A>] (1963) pp. 15-21 and pp. 241-332.
</P>

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Definitions or axioms?</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Levy presents our three definitions above as axioms rather than definitions.
There is nothing wrong with this in principle, but because they are
conservative and eliminable, they do not strengthen the underlying set theory.
They just specify a mechanical transformation to and from a different but
equivalent notation.
</P>

<P>
On the other hand, they have a character that is somewhat different from
"ordinary" definitions such as ~ df-an that simply introduce a new symbol (or
unique symbol combination) to abbreviate a longer string of symbols.  All such
ordinary definitions can be verified for soundness with a relatively
straightforward algorithm that is incorporated into the mmj2 program.  But
there is no simple way to verify automatically the soundness of our three class
definitions.  Instead, we must trust the relatively involved metamathematics of
Levy's (or other authors') eliminability and conservation proofs that exist
only on paper, at least until a sufficiently sophisticated definitional
soundness checker becomes available.  The requirement of such trust makes it
tempting to call them axioms, since that would relieve us of responsibility in
the unlikely event that a flaw is uncovered in one of the
eliminability/conservation proofs.
</P>

<P>
Personally I feel that despite their formal complexity, the
eliminability/conservation properties are still in some sense "obvious,"
particularly after gaining some experience with examples such as the
above.  Moreover, calling them axioms could be slightly misleading by
suggesting that the axioms of ZFC set theory are not sufficient.  For
these reasons I chose to call them definitions, at the risk of slightly
compromising the ideal of computer-verified perfect rigor.  It is rather
trivial in the Metamath language to switch them to axioms if we want to
achieve this rigor, since the distinction between the two is merely a
naming convention of "ax-" vs.  "df-" prefixes; see the discussion below
on <A HREF="#definitions">definitions</A>.
</P>

<P>
The specific reason that the current mmj2 definitional soundness checker will
reject our three definitions for classes is that they overload (and thus in a
naive sense redefine) existing connectives.  There is one other definition in
the set.mm database that mmj2 is unable to check: ~ df-bi , which does not
connect definiendum and definiens with ` <-> ` or ` = ` .  For these four
cases, it is assumed that we are satisfied with a soundness justification
outside of Metamath or its tools, and we specify them as exceptions in mmj2's
RunParms.txt file:

<P>
A skeptic is free to rename these four to be axioms (with prefix "ax-"), but
currently we consider the compromise acceptable.  Moreover, the above mmj2
statement tells us exactly which definitions we are trusting without computer
verification, so we can easily determine exactly what is being assumed.

The complete proof of a theorem all the way back to axioms can be thought of as
a tree of subtheorems, with the steps in each proof branching back to earlier
subtheorems, until axioms are ultimately reached at the tips of the branches.
An interesting exercise is, starting from a theorem, to try to find the longest
path back to an axiom.
<B>Trivia Question:</B> What is the longest path for the theorem 2 + 2 = 4?

A longest path back to an axiom from 2 + 2 = 4 is <B>184 layers</B> deep!  By
following it you will encounter a broad range of interesting and important set
theory results along the way.  You can follow them by drilling down this path.
Or you can start at the bottom and work your way up, watching mathematics

complex numbers&mdash;i.e. we are really proving (2+0i) + (2+0i) =

<A HREF="mmcomplex.html#axioms">Axioms for Complex Numbers</A>) but provide the
most flexibility for the arithmetic in our set.mm database.  In terms of
textbook pages, the construction formalizes perhaps 70 pages from Takeuti and
Zaring's <I>Introduction to Axiomatic Set Theory</I> (and its predicate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Metamath axiom system defined in set.mm is founded on a simplified
formalization of predicate calculus with equality published by logician Alfred
Tarski in 1965 (see [<A HREF="#Tarski">Tarski</A>], system S2 mentioned in the
last paragraph of p. 77; reproduced as system S3 in Section 6 of
[<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>]). Tarski's system is exactly equivalent to
the <A HREF="#traditional">traditional</A> textbook formalization, but (by
clever use of equality axioms) it eliminates the latter's primitive notions of
"proper substitution" and "free variable," replacing them with direct
substitution and the notion of a variable not occurring in a formula (which we
express with <A HREF="#distinct">distinct variable</A> constraints).
<!--- 4-Aug-2021 nm </P> here causes http://validator.w3.org failure -->

<P>
In advocating his system, Tarski wrote, "The relatively complicated character
of [free variables and proper substitution] is a source of certain
inconveniences of both practical and theoretical nature; this is clearly
experienced both in teaching an elementary course of mathematical logic and in
formalizing the syntax of predicate logic for some theoretical purposes"
[<A HREF="#Tarski">Tarski</A>, p. 61].
</P>

<!--
<P>Tarski's system still requires nontrivial and somewhat ad hoc
metalogic, such as induction on formula length, to derive theorem
schemes (as opposed to specific theorems).  Theorem schemes are more
efficient for building a body of mathematical knowledge, since they can
be reused with different instances as needed.  However, the metalogic
needed to derive them in Tarski's system is difficult to automate in a
proof verifier.
-->

<P>
Tarski's system was designed for proving specific theorems rather than more
general theorem schemes (which we will define below).  However, theorem schemes
are much more efficient than specific theorems for building a body of
mathematical knowledge, since they can be reused with different instances as
needed.  While Tarski does derive some theorem schemes from his axioms, their
proofs require
<!--
nontrivial and somewhat ad hoc
-->
concepts
that are "outside" of the system, such as induction on formula length.
The verification of such proofs is difficult to automate in a proof
verifier.  (Specifically, Tarski treats the formulas of his system as
set-theoretical objects.  In order to verify the proofs of his theorem
schemes, a proof verifier would need a significant amount of set theory
built into it.)
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="simplemetalogic"></A>
The Metamath axiom system (shown as <A HREF="#scaxioms">ax-1 through ax-13</A>
above) extends Tarski's system to eliminate this difficulty.  The additional
axiom schemes (as we will call them in this section; see below) endow Tarski's
system with a nice property we call <B>scheme completeness</B> (defined in
Remark 9.6 of [<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>] and called
"metalogical completeness" there).  As a result, we can prove
<I>any</I> theorem scheme expressable in the "simple metalogic" of Tarski's
system by using <I>only</I> Metamath's direct substitution rule applied to the
axiom system (and no other metalogical or set-theoretical notions "outside" of
the system).  <B>Simple metalogic</B> consists of schemes containing wff
metavariables (with no arguments) and/or setvar (also called "individual")
metavariables (i.e. in the form of the <A HREF="#wffsyntax">wff syntax</A>
described above), accompanied by optional provisos each stating that two
specified setvar metavariables must be distinct or that a specified setvar
metavariable may not occur in a specified wff metavariable.  Metamath's logic
and set theory axiom and rule schemes are all examples of simple metalogic.
The schemes

simple metalogic, because they use wff metavariables with

<P>
<A NAME="schemes"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Axioms vs. axiom
schemes</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important thing to keep in mind
is that Metamath's "axioms" and "theorems" are not the actual axioms and
theorems of first-order logic (i.e. the <A
HREF="#traditional">traditional predicate calculus</A>
of textbooks) but instead should be interpreted as <B>schemes</B>, or
recipes, for generating those axioms and theorems.  In particular, the
(red) "setvar variables" in Metamath's axioms are <I>not</I> the individual
variables of the actual axioms; instead, they are metavariables ranging
over these individual variables (which in turn range over the
individuals in the logic's universe of discourse&mdash;in our case of
set theory, the universe of discourse is the collection of all sets).
This can cause and has caused confusion, particularly because of the
superficial resemblance between the two.  For clarity,
we will refer to Metamath's axioms as axiom schemes in this section and
whenever we discuss Metamath in the context of first-order logic.
</P>

<P>
The <I>actual</I> language (also called the object language) of first-order
logic consists of starting (or primitive or atomic) wffs (well-formed formulas)
constructed from actual individual variables
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>,
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>,
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>,... connected by ` = ` and ` e. `
(such as
"<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> ` = `
 <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>4</SUB></FONT>"
and
"<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` e. `
 <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>"),
which are then used to build up larger wffs with the connectives ` -> ` ,
` -. ` , and ` A. ` (such as
"` ( -. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>4</SUB></FONT> ` -> A. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>6</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` e. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>` ) `").
That is the complete language needed to express all of set theory and thus
essentially all of mathematics.  That's it; there is nothing else!  There are
no other variable types in the actual language; in particular <I>there are no
variables representing wffs.</I> Each of our axiom schemes corresponds to
(generates) an infinite set of such actual formulas that match its pattern.
For example, "(` A. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> ` -. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` e. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> ` -> -. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` e. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>)"
is an actual axiom since it matches axiom scheme ~ ax-c5 ,
"` ( A. x ph -> ph ) ` ," when we substitute
"<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>" for "` x `" and "` -. `
 <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` e. `
 <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>" for "` ph ` ."
</P>

<P>
Even in propositional calculus, the "axioms" are really axiom schemes.
Although logic textbooks may have "propositional variables" that are
manipulated directly and even treated as primitive for convenience (or certain
theoretical purposes), they are really wff metavariables when used as part of
the foundations for mathematics.  An actual axiom of propositional calculus has
no propositional or wff variables but only the kinds of actual wffs we just
described.  Each axiom scheme is a template corresponding to an infinite number
of actual axioms.

For example, neither the general form of ~ ax-1 &nbsp;
"` ( ph -> ( ps -> ph ) ) `"&nbsp;
nor the more restrictive substitution instance&nbsp;
"` ( x = y -> ( x = y -> x = y ) ) `"&nbsp;
is an actual axiom&mdash;both are schemes ranging over an infinite number of
actual axioms, with fewer (in the proper subset sense) actual axioms in the
second case, of course.  An example of an actual propositional calculus axiom
is the instance&nbsp;
"` ( `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>5</SUB></FONT> ` -> ( A. `

<P>
Our extensions ~ ax-10 through ~ ax-13 are provable (outside of Metamath) as
metatheorems of Tarski's original system, meaning that they are sound (and also
logically redundant).  Specifically, all instances of our extensions not
involving wff metavariables (and with all setvar metavariables mutually
distinct) can be proved inside of Metamath from Tarski's axiom schemes; see
theorem schemes ~ ax10w , ~ ax11w , ~ ax12w , and ~ ax13w . These theorem
schemes have hypotheses that can be eliminated for such instances.  Theorem ~
ax12wdemo shows an example of how we can eliminate the hypotheses of ~ ax12w .
Finally, we combine all such instances (outside of Metamath) to result in the
metatheorem represented by our extensions.
</P>

<P>
Except for ~ ax-6 , our system includes all axiom schemes of Tarski's
system.  In the case of ax-6, Tarski's version is weaker because it
includes a distinct variable proviso.  If we wish, we can also weaken
our version in this way and still have a system that is scheme-complete.
Theorem ~ ax6 shows this by deriving, in the presence of the other
axioms, our ax-6 from Tarski's weaker version ~ ax6v . However, we chose
the stronger version for our system because it is simpler to state and
easier to use.  (Technically, our ~ ax-7 , ~ ax-8 , and ~ ax-9 are
sub-schemes of a single higher-order scheme in Tarski's system, but
these three suffice to make our system complete.  Breaking them out
makes our metalogic simpler by avoiding the need for a notion of
substitution into an atomic wff.)

<P>
<A NAME="schemesubst"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Substitution
instances of schemes</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Metamath, by
default (i.e. when no distinct variable provisos are present; see <A
HREF="#axiomnotedv">below</A>) there are no restrictions on
substitutions that may be made into a scheme, provided we honor the
metavariable types (wff variable or setvar variable).  This is called
<B>direct substitution</B>, in constrast to a more complicated "proper
substitution" used in textbook predicate calculus.  Consider, for
example, axiom scheme ~ ax-6 , which can be abbreviated as "` E. x ` ` x = y `"
(theorem scheme ~ ax6e ), "there exists (` E. `) an ` x `
such that ` x ` equals ` y ` ."  In traditional predicate
calculus, the first argument (a variable) of the quantifier
` E. ` is considered "bound" in the wff serving as its second
argument (i.e. in the quantifier's "scope"), otherwise it is
"free."  Substitutions must follow careful rules taking into account
of whether the variable is bound or free at a given position.  In the
Metamath language, ` E. `
is merely a 2-place prefix connective or "operation" that evaluates to a
wff, taking a setvar variable as its first argument and a wff as its
second, with no built-in concept of bound or free.  In ~ ax6e , we place no
restriction on what actual variables may be substituted for bound metavariable
` x ` and free metavariable ` y ` .  We can even substitute them with the same
variable, seemingly at odds with the traditional rule that free and
bound variables must not clash.
<!--
In fact, ` x ` and ` y ` are metavariables and not the actual individual
variables that predicate calculus refers to.
-->
(When we do need to prohibit certain substitutions, they are done with
"distinct variable" provisos we describe below, that apply to a theorem as a
whole without consideration of whether a variable's occurrence is free or
bound.  This makes makes figuring out what substitutions are allowed very
simple.)
</P>

<P>
The expression "` E. x ` ` x = y `" is just a recipe for generating an infinite
number of actual axioms.  In an actual axiom such as "` E. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>," symbols
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> and
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> always represent distinct variables
by definition, because they have different names.
<!--
(This is what
traditional predicate calculus means when it says that free variable
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> and bound variable
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> must be distinct i.e. can't
both be substituted with a common third variable.)
-->
Another axiom that results from the recipe is "` E. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>,"
which has a different meaning but is still perfectly sound.
<!--
(Traditional predicate calculus will say that this expression has a bound
variable <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> and no free variables.)
-->
On the other hand, when working with the <I>actual</I> axioms there is no rule
that allows us to infer "` E. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>"
from "` E. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>":
they are independent axioms generated by the scheme.  In the actual logic, the
only rules of inference are the (infinite) specific instances of the
<A HREF="ax-mp.html">modus ponens</A> and
<A HREF="ax-gen.html">generalization</A> schemes&mdash;for example, from
"` E. ` <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>" we can infer
"` A. ` <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>6</SUB></FONT>` E. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>"
by generalization&mdash;and there is no substitution rule built in as a
primitive notion.
</P>

<P>
The proper substitution rule of traditional predicate calculus is a by-product
of the axiom schemes that were chosen, and the rule is necessary to ensure that
these schemes generate only correct actual axioms.  Metamath uses different
axiom schemes that do not require proper substitution but generate exactly the
same actual axioms as traditional predicate calculus.  (A price we pay with
Metamath is a larger number of axiom schemes.)  In the actual axioms, there are
no primitive concepts of "free", "bound", "distinct", or even
"substitution"&mdash;these are all metamathematical notions at the scheme
level.

logic</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...and is not itself the language of first-order logic.  But the "meta" aspect
runs deeper than just the fact that its axioms represent schemes.
</P>

<P>
Traditional presentations of first-order logic also use schemes to describe the
axioms.  However, a substitution instance of one of their axiom schemes is
intended to be one specific axiom of the actual logic.  Formal proofs are
defined so that they involve only actual axioms, to result in actual theorems.
Often textbooks will derive theorem schemes to obtain more generally useful
results, but such derivations are understood to be outside of the logic itself
and may use metalogical techniques such as induction on formula length that are
not part of the axiom system.
</P>

<P>
Metamath's key and very important difference is that an application of its
substitution rule <I>always creates a new scheme from an old one.</I>  Metamath
works <I>only</I> with schemes and <I>never</I> with actual axioms or theorems.

For example, the schemes "` ( x = y -> x = y ) `" and
"` ( ( ps -> ph ) -> ( ps -> ph ) ) `" are two substitution instances that we
can infer from the scheme "` ( ph -> ph ) ` ."  These substitution instances
are new schemes in their own right, into which we can make further
substitutions to specialize them further if we wish.
</P>

<P>
The setvar and wff variables of the Metamath language are one level up, or
"meta," from the point of view of the logic that it describes.  (Hence the name
<I>Metamath</I>, meaning "metavariable math.")  Each "theorem" on our proof
pages is a theorem scheme (metatheorem) that is a recipe for generating an
infinite number of actual theorems.  <A NAME="mentioned"></A> In fact, the
Metamath language cannot even express specific, actual theorems such as "` ( `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> ` -> `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>` ) ` ."
We would have to do that outside of the Metamath system.  Ordinarily this is
unnecessary; even logic textbooks work informally with theorem schemes after
they explain how the formal system is constructed.  Metamath formalizes the
process for working directly with schemes and makes the necessary metalogic
(its substitution rule) part of the axiom system itself, so that no techniques
outside of the axiom system are needed to derive its theorem schemes.

[As an example of the savings we achieve by using only schemes, the ~ 2p2e4
proof described in <A HREF="#trivia">2 + 2 = 4 Trivia</A> above requires 26,323
proof steps to be proved from the axioms of logic and set theory.  If we were
not allowed to use different instances of intermediate theorem schemes but had
to show a direct object-language proof, where each step is an actual axiom or a

<A NAME="axiomnotedv"></A>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Distinct metavariables</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sometimes we must place restrictions on the formulas generated by a scheme in
order to ensure their soundness, and we use <A HREF="#distinct">distinct
variable</A> restrictions for this purpose.  For example, the theorem scheme
~ dtru , ` -. A. x ` ` x = y ` , has the restriction that metavariables ` x `
and ` y ` cannot be substituted with the same actual variable, otherwise we
could end up with the nonsense substitution instance "` -. A. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> ` = `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>"
which would mean "it is not true that every object
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> equals itself."
The substitution rule of Metamath ensures that distinct variable restrictions
"propagate" from axiom schemes having such restrictions into theorem schemes
using those axiom schemes; in other words, distinct variable restrictions in
axiom schemes are inherited by theorems whose proofs make use of those schemes.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="dtru"></A>
Note that distinct variable restrictions are <I>metalogical</I> conditions
imposed on certain axiom and theorem <I>schemes.</I> They have no role in the
actual logic (object language), where two actual variables with different names
are distinct by definition&mdash;simply because they have different names,
which is what "distinct" means.  Thus in an actual theorem generated by
~ dtru , such as "` -. A. ` <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> <I>v</I>
<FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> = <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>,"
it would be redundant (and meaningless) to require that <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1>
<SUB>1</SUB></FONT> and <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT> be distinct.
There is no danger of inferring from this the falsehood "` -. A. ` <I>v</I>
<FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>
= <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT>", because there is no substitution
rule in the actual language that lets us do so.
</P>

<P>As we
<!--
<A HREF="#mentioned">mentioned</A>,
-->
mentioned (three paragraphs earlier), the Metamath language itself
cannot express actual theorems such as "` -. A. `
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> <I>v</I><FONT
SIZE=-1><SUB>1</SUB></FONT> = <I>v</I><FONT
SIZE=-1><SUB>2</SUB></FONT>."  Instead, the distinct variable
restriction on ~ dtru is enforced at the level of
theorem schemes.  In this example, we are not allowed to substitute the
same metavariable, say ` z ` , for
both ` x ` and ` y ` whenever we reference ~ dtru in a proof step.

<B>1.</B> For anyone interested, here are some technical notes on the [<A
HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>] paper.  The claim in Remark 9.6, "C14' is
omitted from S3' because it can be proved from the others using only
simple metalogic," is proved in theorem ~ axc14 .
Axiom C16' is also redundant&mdash;see theorem ~ axc16 , whose proof was
discovered in 2006 and not
known at the time of the paper.  The somewhat strange-looking axiom C10'
( ~ ax-c10 ) was found to be equivalent to the simpler ~ ax-6 after
the paper was submitted; see theorem ~ ax6fromc10 .  In the
proof of the scheme (or "metalogical") completeness theorem,
Theorem 9.7, some details
that are stated without proof as "provable in S3' with simple
metalogic," but which are nonetheless are tricky, are proved by theorems
~ sbequ , ~ sbcom2 , and ~ sbid2v .
</P>

<P>
<B>2.</B> Some people find it counter-intuitive that ~ ax-6 combines
two conceptually different axiom schemes, one where ` x ` and ` y ` are
always distinct variables (one bound, one free) and another which really
means "` E. x ` ` x = x ` ." Raph Levien calls this "bundling" (see <A

variable in its scope).  If we want the system to have scheme
completeness, we must be able to derive our bundled axiom schemes as
theorems.  For example, we can prove our bundled ~ ax-6 from the weaker
non-bundled version that requires its variables to be distinct, as theorem
~ ax6 shows, but the proof is not trivial and makes use of all of the
other axioms. -->

<P>
<B>3.</B> Tarski used the bundled axiom scheme "` E. x ` ` x = y `" in one
of his systems without requiring that ` x ` and ` y ` be distinct variables
(see [<A HREF="#KalishMontague">KalishMontague</A>], footnote on p. 81).  In
other words, he bundled it like we do to make it more general and able
to prove instances of "` E. x ` ` x = x `" without
requiring a separate axiom scheme.  On the other hand, he required that
` x ` and ` y ` be distinct in this scheme of his system S2
mentioned above, since instances of "` E. x ` ` x = x `" could be derived
in another way (see the proof of ~ equid1 ).  Tarski considered it better to
include the distinct variable condition since he wanted to show the weakest
possible axiom scheme needed for completeness, even though it made the
statement of the scheme more complex.
</P>

<P>
<B>4.</B> An interesting feature of Metamath's axiom system is that
it is <I>finitely axiomatized</I> in the following strong sense:  at any
point in a proof, there are only finitely many axiom schemes in the
system from which the next step can be chosen, and whenever the choice
is valid i.e. unifies, there is a unique <I>most general theorem</I>
that that results.  This fact is exploited and illustrated in the <A
HREF="../mmsolitaire/mms.html">Metamath Solitaire</A> applet:  you are
presented with exactly all possible allowed (unifiable) choices, and
when you choose one you are shown the most general theorem that results.
This is in sharp contrast to traditional predicate calculus (and even
Tarski's system), where we must choose from an infinite number of
substitution possibilities in order to apply an axiom.  In particular,
ZFC set theory also becomes finitely axiomatized in this strong sense,
because the Replacement Scheme of ZFC becomes a single "axiom" (or more
precisely, a single scheme expressable in simple metalogic) under
Metamath's formalization.  (Note that the terminology "finitely
axiomatized" is also used in the literature in a different way, to mean
a theory with finitely many actual axioms on top of predicate calculus,
<I>without</I> counting the infinite number of axioms of predicate
calculus itself.  For example, under that meaning, ZFC set theory is not
finitely axiomatized because its Axiom of Replacement is a scheme
describing an infinite number of axioms.)
</P>

<P>
<B>5.</B> Interestingly, Raph Levien has shown (see Item 16 on the <A
HREF="../award2003.html#16">Workshop Miscellany</A> page) that in the
actual logic, if we are given "` E. ` <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT> = <I>v</I>
<FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>3</SUB></FONT>"
as a hypothesis, it is impossible to infer from it, in the absence of
scheme ~ ax-6 , even the obvious equivalent "` E. ` <I>v</I><FONT
SIZE=-1><SUB>4</SUB></FONT> <I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>4</SUB></FONT> =
<I>v</I><FONT SIZE=-1><SUB>4</SUB></FONT>."
<!-- This illustrates
 that bound variable renaming (related to substitution)
 is not part of the axioms themselves
but only of the metamathematics that describes them. -->
<!-- That also shows that a single axiom
representative of ~ ax-6 is not sufficient for the
logic to be complete; we need the infinite number of axioms
corresponding to this Metamath scheme. -->

If you want to acquire a practical working ability in logic, <!-- (as
opposed to just being able to follow mindlessly the symbol manipulations
in our proofs), --> it is a good idea to become familiar with the
traditional textbook axioms.  Their built-in concepts of free and bound
variables and proper substitution are a little more complex than
Metamath's simple substitution rule and concept of two variables
being <A
HREF="#distinct">distinct</A>, but they allow you to work at a
somewhat higher level and are better suited than Metamath's for humans
to understand intuitively.  In fact, many of the proofs here were
sketched out informally using traditional methods before being
formalized with Metamath's axioms.
</P>

<P>
For classical propositional calculus, the traditional axiom and rule
schemes are exactly the same as Metamath's axioms and rule (interpreted
as <A HREF="#schemes">schemes</A>), namely ~ ax-1 ,
~ ax-2 , ~ ax-3 , and rule ~ ax-mp .  The additional axiom and rule schemes for
traditional predicate calculus with equality are the following.  The
first three are the axiom and rule schemes for traditional predicate
calculus, and the last two are the axiom schemes for the traditional
theory of equality.  We link to the approximately equivalent theorem
schemes in the Metamath formalization.

<P>
Even though the traditional axiom system looks different from Metamath's, the
two axiom systems generate exactly the same set of <I>actual</I> theorems.
(Read about <A HREF="#schemes">schemes</A> in the previous section to
understand what "actual" means.)  Specifically, all of Metamath's axiom schemes
<A HREF="#pcaxioms">ax-4 through ax-13</A> can be proved as theorem schemes of
the traditional system.  Conversely, every instance of the traditional axiom
schemes is an instance of a theorem scheme provable from Metamath's axiom
schemes.  Because people familiar with the traditional system have sometimes
felt there is something wrong with ours, particularly since it dispenses with
the alpha conversion required by proper substitution in the traditional axiom
system, this bears repeating: &nbsp;

<B>Our axiom schemes generate precisely the same object-language axioms and
rules, no more and no fewer, as the traditional schemes</B> (Theorem 5 of
[<A HREF="#Tarski">Tarski</A>], p. 78).
</P>

<P>
Although in some sense the traditional axiom schemes are more compact than
Metamath's <A HREF="#pcaxioms">ax-4 through ax-13</A> (4 schemes instead of
10), their purpose is simply to provide recipes for generating actual axioms,
from which we then prove actual theorems.  Theorem schemes can also be proved
from the traditional axiom schemes, but their proofs use informal metalogical
techniques that are not part of the axiom system.  In Metamath, on the other
hand, we deal <I>only</I> with schemes and never with actual axioms, and its
formalization is designed to let us prove directly all possible theorem schemes
of a certain kind (specifically, all possible schemes expressible in
<A HREF="#simplemetalogic">simple metalogic</A>).
</P>

<P>
Metamath's system does not have the traditional system's (metalogical) notions
of "not free in" and "free for" built in, so the traditional system's schemes
cannot be translated exactly to schemes in the Metamath language.  However, we
can emulate these notions (in either system, actually, since every scheme in
Metamath's system <I>is</I> a scheme of the traditional system) with
conventions that are based on a formula's <I>logical</I> properties (rather
than its <I>structure,</I> as is the case with the traditional axioms).
</P>

<P>
To say that "` x ` is effectively not free in ` ph ` ," we can use the
hypothesis ` ph -> A. x ph ` .  This hypothesis holds in all cases where ` x `
is not free in ` ph ` in the traditional system (and in a few other cases as
well, which is why we say "effectively"&mdash;for example, the wff ` x = x `
will satisfy the hypothesis, as shown by theorem ~ hbequid , even though ` x `
is technically free in it).

Because the idiom for "effectively not free in" is so frequently used, we
define a special logical connective, ` F/ x ph ` , that stands for
` A. x ( ph -> A. x ph ) ` .  See definition ~ df-nf .
</P>

<P>
We can emulate "free for" through the use of our definition of proper
substitution ~ df-sb , as shown for example in the approximate equivalent to
~ stdpc4 in the table above.
</P>

<!-- In all, the traditional schemes requiring the notions of "not free
in" and "free for" can be emulated with Metamath schemes ~ stdpc4 , ~ stdpc5 ,
and ~ stdpc7 , assisted by some technical lemmas (needed
to prove, for example, theorems of the form ` ph -> A. x ph ` in order to
satisfy the hypothesis of ~ stdpc5 &mdash;in particular our hb* theorems such
as ~ hbim and also ~ ax-5 ).  -->

<P>
Both our system and the traditional system are called <B>Hilbert-style</B>
systems.  Two other approaches, called <B>natural deduction</B> and
<B>Gentzen-style</B> systems, are closely related to each other and embed the
<A HREF="mmdeduction.html"> deduction (meta)theorem</A> into its axiom system.
Natural deduction is straightforward to emulate in our Hilbert-style system by
exploiting the properties of wff metavariables, using the rules described on
the <A HREF="natded.html">deduction form and natural deduction</A> page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In logic and set theory literature, theorems (or more precisely, theorem
schemes) are often accompanied by side conditions, or provisos, written in
informal English.  Typically these are written after the statement of the
theorem and expressed in a form such as "where <I>x</I> is a variable that
[satisfies some constraint]."  In order to satisfy the metalogical requirements
of <A HREF="#axiomnote">Tarski's axiom system</A> on which it is based,
Metamath implements three kinds of provisos through the use of its "distinct
variable" conditions.  These restrict what substitutions are allowed, and often
you will see a proviso such as the following accompanying an axiom or theorem
(for example, ~ ax-5 and ~ dtru ):

<CENTER>Distinct variable groups:

These three groups (in this example 3 pairs)  have the following meanings,
respectively, as side conditions of the theorem scheme or axiom scheme shown
above them:
<OL>
<LI>
where ` x ` and ` y ` may not be substituted with the same setvar variable,
</LI>
<LI>

wff expression substituted for ` ph ` , and
</LI>
<LI>
where whatever setvar variable is substituted for ` x ` may not appear in the
class expression substituted for ` A ` .
</LI>
</OL>
For brevity we may say more informally,
<OL>
<LI>
where ` x ` and ` y ` are distinct,
</LI>
<LI>
where ` x ` does not occur in ` ph ` , and

<LI>
where ` x ` does not occur in ` A ` .

<FONT SIZE="-1">
[Actually, there is only <I>one</I> rule in the Metamath language itself: the
two expressions that are substituted for the two variables in a distinct
variable pair must not have any variables in common.  This is why a distinct
variable pair is officially called a "disjoint variable pair" in the Metamath
specification.  We present the rule as three separate cases above for clarity.
In the set theory database file, set.mm, we adopt the convention that at least
one setvar variable always appears in a distinct variable pair, so these are
the only cases you will see.  Under this convention, a distinct variable pair
such as "` A ` ,` ph `" will never occur, even though technically it is not
illegal.]

Distinct variable group: &nbsp; ` ph ` ,` x `

means the same thing as
<P>
<CENTER>
Distinct variable group: &nbsp; ` x ` ,` ph `

<P>
Finally, if more than two variables appear in a group, this is an abbreviated
way of saying that the restrictions apply to all possible pairs in the group.
So,

Distinct variable groups: &nbsp;

<P>
The basic rule to remember is that <B>distinct variable provisos are inherited
by substitutions</B> (that take place in a proof step).  For example, look at
Step 1 of the proof of ~ cleljustALT , which has a substitution instance of
~ ax-5 .  As you can see, ~ ax-5 requires the distinct variable pair ` x ` ,
` ph ` .

Step 1  substitutes ` z ` for ` x ` and ` x e. y ` for ` ph ` .

This substitution transforms the original distinct variable requirement into
the two distinct variable pairs ` z ` ,` x ` and ` z ` ,` y ` , which will
implicitly accompany step 1 (although not shown explicitly in step 1 of the
proof listing).  Thus step 1 can be read in full, "` ( x e. y -> A. z `
` x e. y ) ` where ` z ` ,` x ` are distinct and ` z ` ,` y ` are distinct."
The proof verifier will check that this requirement accompanies the final
theorem, otherwise it will flag the proof step as invalid.  You can see this
requirement in the "Distinct variable groups" list on the ~ cleljustALT page.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="dvexample"></A>This can be confusing if you don't understand
how distinct variables requirements are inherited from referenced axioms
or theorems in order to satisfy their distinct variable requirements.
Let us consider an example (courtesy of G&eacute;rard Lang).  Naively,
one might think that ~ ax-13 (which has no
distinct variable requirements) is derivable from ~ ax-5 , arguing as follows.
Since the letter ` x ` has no occurrence in
the wff ` y = z ` , one might think that a direct
application of ~ ax-5 would give (` y = z -> A. x ` ` y = z `) as a theorem
with no distinct variable requirements, so that ~ ax-13 easily
follows by adding an antecedent with ~ a1i .
However, "distinct" does not <I>merely</I> mean that two setvar variables
have different names; it means that we also must prevent them from being
substituted with the same setvar variable in the future.  (To be precise,
they must represent object language variables with different names; see
<A HREF="#schemes">Axioms vs. axiom schemes</A> and <A
HREF="#axiomnotedv">Distinct metavariables</A> above.)  To apply ~ ax-5 ,
we must explicitly ensure that ` x ` is distinct from both
` y ` and ` z ` in ` y = z ` by adding two distinct variable requirements.
Otherwise, we could further substitute ` x ` for ` y ` to
arrive at (` x = z -> A. x ` ` x = z `); this violates the ~ ax-5 requirement
since ` x ` <I>does</I> appear in ` x = z ` .
In fact, from ~ ax-5 we can conclude only the
very restricted theorem ~ ax13w , which because of
its distinct variable requirements is much weaker than axiom ~ ax-13 .
(If we omit them, the Metamath proof verifier will give an error message.)
We say that the distinct variable requirements in ~ ax13w are inherited
from ~ ax-5 .
</P>

<P>
In the Metamath language, distinct variable requirements are specified with $d
statements, placed before an assertion ($a or $p) and  in the same scope.  Each
theorem must be accompanied by those $d statements needed to satisfy all
distinct variable requirements implicitly attached the proof steps.
</P>

<P>
To get a concrete feel for distinct variable requirements, you can temporarily
comment out the "$d x z $." condition for theorem ~ cleljustALT in the database
file set.mm.   When you try to verify the proof with the
<A HREF="../index.html#mmprog">Metamath program</A>, the resulting error
message will read as follows.  (Note that the "normal" proof format is used,
which you can convert to with "save proof cleljustALT /normal", and step 25
here corresponds to step 1 on the web page; steps 1&ndash;24 are syntax
building steps that can be seen with "show proof cleljustALT /all" while step
25 is the first essentiel step.)

There is a disjoint variable ($d) violation at proof step 25.  Assertion "ax-5"
requires that variables "ph" and "x" be disjoint.  But "ph" was substituted

Variables "x" and "z" do not have a disjoint variable requirement in the

Such error messages can also be used to determine any missing $d statements

The idea of using distinct variable conditions in place of the more
complicated free-variable concept of <A HREF="#traditional">traditional
predicate calculus</A> was first stated by Tarski in 1951, with proofs
published in 1965 [<A HREF="#Tarski">Tarski</A>, p. 61, footnote].  It
also allows us to dispense with proper substitution as a primitive
notion in the axiom system:  "Instead of the general notion of proper
substitution we use...a much more elementary and special notion:  that
of replacement, of one variable by another, in an atomic formula."  [<A
HREF="#Tarski">Tarski</A>, p. 62].

Sometimes new or "dummy" variables are used inside of a proof that do not
appear in the theorem being proved.  On the web pages we omit them from the
"Distinct variable group(s)" list, which is intended to show only those
distinct variable requirements that need to be satisfied by any proof that
<I>references</I> the theorem.
</P>

<P>
If a proof uses dummy variables, we list them on a separate line beginning
"Dummy variables...".  For simplicity, we assume that dummy variables are
mutually distinct and distinct from all other variables, and this assumption
is indicated after the list.
</P>

<P>
Sometimes it is not strictly necessary for a dummy variable to be distinct from
certain other variables, for example when those variables do not participate in
the part of the proof using the dummy variable.  In that case, it is
<I>optional</I> whether or not we include those variables paired with the dummy
variable in $d statements in the set.mm file.  Sometimes you will see such
optional $d statements omitted, depending on the preferences of the person who
created the proof.
</P>

<P>
In principle, we could list on the web page only those pairs with dummy
variables that are actually specified to be distinct in the set.mm file.
However, that would make the "Dummy variable" list very long for some theorems
with many variables, full of gaps and hard to read.  (We used to do something
like that, and people didn't like it.)  So for simplicity, we just assume that
all possible variable pairs with dummy variables are distinct, which is a
conservative assumption that will always work.  This assumption makes it
easiest to follow the proof since you don't have to keep checking a distinct
variable list.  If you want to see which ones were actually specified for a
particular proof, you can consult the set.mm source file or use the metamath
program command 'show statement ...  /full'.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An issue that has been debated is whether the Metamath language specification
should be changed so that $d statements associated with dummy variables are
assumed implicitly.  This is partly a matter of taste, but so far I have felt
it better to require explicit $d statements for them.  There are good arguments
both ways, but to me, philosophically it makes the language more transparent,
if more tedious.  Beginners may find an explicit list helpful for understanding
proofs, since nothing is hidden.  Making it optional would complicate the
Metamath spec slightly, since it would  require an exception added to $d
verification.  If we want to use a proof step as a theorem (such as when
breaking a proof into lemmas), its subproof may fail if the step has previously
dummy variables whose $d statements are hidden.
<!-- And importantly, existing databases are
compatible with either method, whereas if someday we make $d statements
optional for dummy variables, it would be hard to go back. -->
</P>

<P>
Some people who dislike this requirement  have made $d statements for dummy
variables optional for their Metamath language verifiers (although strictly
speaking this violates the current Metamath spec); an example is
<A HREF="../other.html#hmm">Hmm</A>.  There is nothing wrong with this in
principle, and we could even make <I>all</I> $d statements for theorems
optional&mdash;see <A HREF="#dvnote5">Note 5</A> below.

Textbooks often use the notation ` ph `(` x `) to denote that variable ` x `
may appear in a wff substituted for ` ph ` .  The Metamath language doesn't
have a notation like this, but we can achieve the logical equivalent simply by
<I>omitting</I> the distinct variable group ` x ` ,` ph ` , as the example
~ axsep shows.
</P>

<!-- Since this isn't obvious from the theorem itself, it is
important to pay attention to the distinct variable groups to detect
this intent.  Often, as we do for ~ axsep , we
will note the intent in the theorem's description.

<P>
In a sense, Metamath is opposite from the usual textbook convention: in
Metamath, <I>any</I> variable may appear in a substitution instance of a wff by
default; it is the <I>exceptions</I> that must be made explicit with distinct
variable requirements.  Keeping this in mind may make the comparison to logic
textbooks a little easier.

We can reconstruct the ` ph `(` x `) notation from the distinct variable
conditions that are omitted.  On the individual web pages, this reconstruction
for wff and class variables is shown under the "Distinct variable groups" list
and called "Allowed substitution hints".  <!-- It is essentially the complement
of the distinct variable groups involving wff or class variables.  --> The
notation ` ph `(` x `) there means that ` x ` may appear (free, bound, or
both) in any expression substituted for wff variable ` ph ` .  Note that
this is an informal, unofficial notation, not part of the Metamath language.
<!-- , and shouldn't be confused with the notation ` [ x / y ] ph `
which means "the proper substitution of ` x ` for ` y `" ( ~ df-sb ).  -->
</P>

<P>
Keep in mind that the "Allowed substitution hints" are <I>not</I> necessarily a
complete list of all possible substitutions but are provided as a convenience
to help you more easily determine what substitutions are allowed, in contrast
to the "Distinct variable groups" which tell you which ones are forbidden.
There are six things to be aware of.
</P>

<P>
1. If the theorem has no "Distinct variable groups", such as ~ mpteq2ia , any
substitution at all (honoring the variable types) is permissable, so an
"Allowed substitution hints" list would be pointless and is not shown to reduce
possibly-confusing clutter.
</P>

<P>
2. If the theorem has "Distinct variable groups" and a wff or class variable is
missing from the "Allowed substitution hints", such as the ` A ` in ~ copsexg ,
it means (in this case) that neither of the setvar variables ` x ` or ` y ` may
appear in a class expression substituted for ` A ` .  It is acceptable to
substitute any class expression for ` A ` that <I>doesn't</I> contain these two
variables but possibly contains others such as ` z ` .
</P>

<P>
3. If the theorem has "Distinct variable groups" but does not have an "Allowed
substitution hints" list, such as ~ dftr5 , it means that none of the setvar
variables in the theorem or its hypotheses may appear in expressions
substituted for its wff or class variables; in this case, neither ` x ` nor
` y ` may appear in an expression substituted for ` A ` .  Other setvar
variables such as ` z ` may appear, though.  This includes any dummy variables
that may be used by the proof, since they do not appear in the theorem or its
hypotheses.
</P>

<P>
4. The list of variables in parentheses after a wff or class variable shows the
permissable setvar variables that may appear in a substitution <I>among those
in the theorem</I> (or its hypotheses).  There is nothing preventing the use of
setvar variables that do not appear in the theorem.  For example, in ~ axsep ,
` x ` and ` w ` may appear in an expression substituted for ` ph ` , but not
` y ` or ` z ` .
</P>

<P>
5. The setvar variable list in parentheses says nothing about whether those
setvar variables need to be mutually distinct.  Only the "Distinct variable
groups" list provides this information.  For example, ` ph `(` x ` ,` y `)
appears in the "Allowed substitution hints" for both ~ ralcom and ~ ralcom2 ;
` x ` and ` y ` must be distinct in the former but not the latter.
</P>

<P>
6. The hypotheses of a theorem may impose additional conditions on how the
variables in parentheses may appear in the wff or class variable.  For example,
in ~ vtoclef , although ` x ` may appear in the expression substituted for
` ph ` , it must appear in a way that allows the first hypothesis

<!--
` ( ph -> `
` A. x ph ) `
-->

` F/ x ph ` to be satisfied.
Thus ` x ` usually can't occur as a free variable in  ` ph ` because the
first hypothesis won't be satisfied.  This is in contrast to informal
textbook usage where ` ph `(` x `) typically means ` x ` occurs as a free
variable in ` ph ` .  The way to tell whether the meaning
is "may occur free or bound" or "may occur
if bound by a quantifier" is to look for a hypothesis of this form.
</P>

<!-- The list of allowed substitutions is shown only when (1) the theorem has
distinct variable restrictions and (2) at least one wff or class variable may
contain one or more set variables belonging to the theorem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Distinct variable requirements are sometimes confusing to Metamath newcomers.
Unlike traditional predicate
calculus, Metamath does not confer a special status to a bound variable
(e.g. the quantifier variable ` x ` in ` A. x ph `); there is no built-in
concept of its "scope."  All variables, whether free or bound, are subject
to the same direct substitution rule.  Metamath's substitution rule does
not treat a variable after the quantifier symbol "` A. `" any differently
from a variable after any other constant connective such as "` -. `".
The only thing that matters is that the syntax is legal
for the variable type (wff, setvar, or class), and that any distinct
variable requirements are satisfied.  This different paradigm may take
some getting used to by someone used to traditional "proper
substitution" (which involves analyzing the scopes of bound variables
and renaming them if necessary), even though it is significantly
<I>simpler</I> than the traditional approach.  (Indeed, as described
above, this simplicity was a primary motivation for Tarski's predicate
calculus that Metamath's set.mm axioms are based on.)  Unless
otherwise restricted by a distinct variable condition, a quantified (or
any other) variable is by default <I>not necessarily distinct</I> from
other variables in the same expression, whether bound or not.  This is
opposite the usual implicit assumption in traditional mathematics.  For
example, in many textbooks, it would be implicit that the two variables
in theorem scheme ~ dtru must be distinct
(particularly since
one is bound and the other is free), but in Metamath this requirement
must be made explicit.  (On the other hand, in an <I>instance</I> of
dtru in the <I>actual</I> logic, which Metamath cannot express directly,
the two variables are implicitly distinct by definition, as explained
the <A HREF="#dtru">"Distinct variables"</A> subsection of Appendix 1
above.)
</P>

<!--
<P>Another reason for confusion may be distinct variable requirements
appear separately from the formula part of a theorem and are implicitly
rather than directly referenced in proofs, possibly making the
relationship between the two unclear to some people.  However, there is
no fundamental difference between a logical hypothesis ($e statement in
the database) and a distinct variable requirement, in that a proof may
be invalid unless it is present.  It can be helpful to think of each
axiom or theorem (and each step in a proof) as being an assertion of the
form "L &amp; D =&gt; C," where L is the (possibly empty) set of
relevant $e statements, D is the (possibly empty) set of relevant $d
statements, and C is the conclusion ($a statement for an axiom or $p
statement for a theorem).  Perhaps a better name for a distinct variable
"requirement" (or "proviso," or "restriction," or "constraint," or "side
condition") would be distinct variable "hypothesis."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interestingly, the
distinct variable requirements ($d statements) accompanying theorems are
theoretically redundant, because the proof verifier could in principle
infer and propagate them forward from the distinct variable requirements
of the axioms.  The <A HREF="../mmsolitaire/mms.html#q7">Metamath
Solitaire</A> applet does this, inferring both the resulting proof steps
and their distinct variable requirements as you feed it axioms to
build a proof.  (The <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A> program will
also infer the necessary $d statements for a proof under development.)
The Metamath language spec, on the other hand, requires them to be
explicit partly to speed up the verifier (for example, otherwise
we couldn't
verify a proof in isolation but would have to analyze every proof it
depends on), but making them explicit also allows someone writing a
proof to easily determine by inspection the distinct variable
requirements of a theorem he or she wishes to reference.

Introducing unnecessary distinct variable groups in a theorem is always allowed

that later theorems may also have to be weaker in order to make use of it.  We

Frederic Line writes,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Concerning the $d statement, here is the way I understand the whole
thing.  Perhaps it can be of some interest for you to understand the
point of view of a non-mathematician having spent some time playing with
metamath.

<P>Predicate calculus needs provisos.  These provisos have a very
strange status in logic books since they are not formalized but are
expressed informally using words.  It is as if they don't belong to the
system (I think you would say they belong to the metalogic).  Some are
not clearly expressed at all (the necessity for the variables to be
distinct).

<P>But in Metamath, provisos are expressed in a formalized way like the
rest.  Metamath knows very little about logic.  The only thing it can do
is verify substitutions.  Provisos don't belong to the metalogic world in
Metamath.  They are formalized:  necessity for a "not free" variable is
expressed by

"` ph -> A. x ph `"

and necessity for distinct variables by

"` -. A. x x = y `".

So the $d statement in fact is absolutely unnecessary in principle.
[See the discussion on the page <A HREF="mmzfcnd.html#distinctors">ZFC
Axioms With No Distinct Variable Conditions</A> - -nm.]

<P>But $d statement can help for two reasons (as I see it).  (1) Dummy
variables are unavoidable (this a consequence of the theorem
[Andr&eacute;ka's theorem] you cite in your <A
HREF="#bibmegill">article</A> in the Notre Dame journal), and it would
be strange to have an antecedent [of the form ` -. A. x x = y `]
involving a [dummy] variable that does not appear in the theorem.  (2)
It can be tedious to have to add antecedents for every variable pair
used in the theorem's proof [i.e. if there are n variables that are all
distinct, you would need n(n-1)/2 antecedents - -nm].

<P>Thus (as I see it) it's for practical reasons that the $d
statement has been added.

have a separate mechanism for introducing definitions and in particular
ensuring their soundness.  The only way to add a definition to a

axiom system can be inconsistent, an unsound definition may lead to an
inconsistency.
<!--
Some people may view this as a
deficiency, so we will discuss its rationale and philosophy in some detail.
-->

<P>
If you don't know what we mean by an unsound definition, here is a simple
example.  Suppose we modify ~ df-2 to become the self-referential expression
"2 = ( 1 + 2 )" instead of its present "2 = ( 1 + 1 )".  From this, we can
easily prove the contradiction 0 = 1. Therefore, this "definition" leads to
inconsistency and is unsound.  But since it is an axiomatic ($a) assertion in
the database, the Metamath proof verifier is perfectly content to use it as a
new fact and does not issue an error message.
</P>

<P>
Thus, the soundness of definitions must be verified independently of the
Metamath proof verifier, either by hand or through the use of a separate
automated tool customized for the logic used by the database.
</P>

<P>
For the specific case of the set theory database set.mm, Mario Carneiro added
an enhancement to the <A HREF="../index.html#mmj2">mmj2</A> program that will

you.  See also the discussion "Definitions or Axioms?" in the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Metamath language provides a very simple and general framework for
describing arbitrary formal systems.  Intrinsically it "knows" nothing
about logic or math; all it does is blindly assure us that we cannot
prove anything not permitted by whatever formal system we have described
to it.  What we call an "axiom" is to Metamath merely a new pattern for
combining symbols that we have told it is permissable.  The same holds
for what we call "definitions"&mdash;to Metamath, definitions merely
extend the formal system with new patterns and are indistinguishable
from axioms by the proof verifier.
</P>

<P>
For convenience, we usually make an artificial distinction by
prefixing definition names with "df-".  But every definition is assumed
to have been metalogically justified <I>outside</I> of the Metamath
formalism as being sound.  A definition is <B>sound</B> provided (1) it
is eliminable (the wff for any theorem containing a defined symbol can
be converted to an equivalent wff without it) and (2) it is conservative
(a theorem should be provable from the original axioms after the
definition is eliminated).
</P>

<P>
This method of introducing definitions as new axioms keeps the Metamath
language simple and not tied to any specific formal system.  A definition that
is sound in one formal system may be unsound in another.  For example, a
recursive definition may not be eliminable in a system too weak to prove the
necessary recursion theorem (and even when it is, its elimination can be quite
complex; see e.g. the discussion of ~ df-rdg ).
</P>

<P>
One extreme viewpoint is to consider all definitions to <I>be</I> additional
axioms, following <!-- ultraconservative --> logicians such as Le&#347;niewski
[C.  Lejewski, "On implicational definitions," <I>Studia Logica</I>
8:189-208 (1958)].

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Le&#347;niewski regards definitions as theses of the system.  In this respect
they do not differ either from the axioms or from theorems, i.e. from the
theses added to the system on the basis of the rule of substitution or the rule
of detachment.  Once definitions have been accepted as theses of the system, it
becomes necessary to consider them as true propositions in the same sense in
which axioms are true.
<I>[p. 190]</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This was roughly the original idea when Metamath was first designed. The
concept of definitional soundness was considered outside of the scope of the
proof verification engine, because it is intrinsically dependent on the
strength of the axiom system.  Instead, definitional soundness was expected to
be verified independently, either by hand or by an automated tool customized
for the particular logic system used by the database.  (Such a tool might
recognize the "df-" prefix as a keyword meaning "definition" and would impose
constraints to guarantee that the definition is sound under the axiom system of
that database.)
<!--- 4-Aug-2021 nm </P> here causes http://validator.w3.org failure -->

<!--
But except for four cases ( ~ df-bi , ~ df-clab , ~ df-cleq , and ~ df-clel ),
we adopt the convention of introducing definitions by connecting a new symbol
(or a unique new combination of symbols) with existing ones using either
` <-> ` (if we are defining a new wff) or ` = ` (if we are defining a new
class).  With this convention, the soundness of definitions is more or less
obvious by inspection.
-->

<P>
In the set theory database set.mm, we have adopted the conservative convention
that most definitions, beyond the basics needed for a practical development of
set theory, consist of a single new class constant symbol followed by an equal
sign followed by a class expression built from earlier symbols, for example the
definition of power class ~ df-pw .  Thus the definition is more or less a
drop-in replacement that abbreviates a fixed, more complicated expression (with
possible renaming of bound variables).  The soundness of such definitions is
simple to check by inspection:  if (1) the left-hand constant symbol is new and
doesn't appear in the right-hand side, (2) all variables are distinct (all of
them appear in a single $d statement), and (3) we can prove (with a Metamath
theorem, e.g. ~ pwjust for ~ df-pw ) that the right-hand expression equals
itself with all variables renamed, then the definition is sound.  This
convention allows all but four definitions to be verified automatically by mmj2
as described above.
</P>

<P>
A non-mathematical (human) issue with a definition is whether it matches the
generally understood meaning of a concept.  For example, if we swapped the
symbols 4 ( ~ df-4 ) and 5 ( ~ df-5 ) everywhere, all definitions would remain
sound, but we could "prove" that ( 2 + 2 ) = 5.  For this reason, all
definitions still must be carefully scrutinized by a competent mathematician,
and obviously there is no way to automate this inspection.
</P>

<!--
<P>
Nonetheless, the present lack of built-in soundness checking of
definitions is a deficiency of Metamath compared to some other proof
languages, and I may revisit it at some point.  An example where it
could be beneficial is in the construction of <A
HREF="mmcomplex.html">complex numbers</A>:  our only goal is to
construct an object ` CC ` with
the desired properties, and we don't really care what "throwaway"
definitions (about 28 of them in the present construction) we use along
the way as long as they are sound.
</P>

<P>
Automated definitional soundness checking will become more important
if Metamath is ever used in a large-scale collaborative project.
However, it is more likely that Ghilbert will be used for that purpose
and that Metamath will continue to be used for smaller, self-contained
projects such as set.mm.  As they have in the past, these two projects
can continue to "feed" each other with new theorems developed on their
respective platforms.

The <A HREF="mmdefinitions.html">definition list (3MB)</A> shows all of the

You shouldn't expect to see immediately the relationship between the

through the proof tree until axioms were reached, and in fact required a
considerable amount of CPU power.  Mathematicians generally like to
prove theorems using as few axioms as possible, which we also usually
try to do, so this list is often the minimum axiom set needed for the

This is particularly useful when "debugging" a proof that we think

Sometimes a proof becomes much longer if we want to avoid a certain

Why did we need Infinity?  Well, our
number 2 is a real number, and the Axiom of Infinity is needed to prove
that any real number exists.  (And why is this?  Very informally, we can
think of an arbitrary real number as having an infinite list of digits
after the decimal point, and we need an axiom that tells us that such
infinite lists exist before we can manipulate them with setvar variables.)
But the place where Infinity is used is buried deep inside the proof
tree&mdash;you have to drill down through  49 layers of proofs to find it.

If you want to see its path all the way to 2 + 2 = 4, locate ~ mulpipq in the

often used by set theorists and has the advantage for us that it is unambiguous
and independent of context.
</P>

<P>
For special functions such as square root, textbooks indicate function values
with an assortment of two-dimensional glyphs and syntactical idioms that may be
ambiguous outside of context.  Our versions may seem unfamiliar because we are
constrained to a linear language and we need context-independent, unambiguous
notation.  We also prefer a single notation for function value to be able to
reuse our rich collection of theorems about function values.  For example, in
the square root theorem ~ sqrtthi , the square root symbol &quot;` sqrt `&quot;
is a function i.e. a class ( ~ csqrt ), and we display the square root of 2 as
"` ( sqrt `` 2 ) `&quot;.  Two other examples are the real part of a complex
number <I><FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">A</FONT></I >, where we use &quot;` ( Re `` A )
`&quot; instead of &quot;` Re A `", and the conjugate of a complex number,
where we use &quot;` ( * `` A ) `&quot; instead of
&quot;` A `<sup>*</sup>&quot; (or sometimes with an overbar), both of which you
can see in theorem ~ cjval .  Another example is the factorial function, which
we express as &quot;` ( ! `` A ) `&quot; instead of &quot;` A ! `&quot; in
~ facnn2 .  In the conventional textbook notation, these four examples use four
different positional relationships to indicate one concept (the value of a
function), but I decided to use a single syntax for all four to make the
development of proofs simpler.
</P>

<P>
There is an exception to the above convention:  the unary minus function
~ df-neg is so common that I decided to create a special syntax for it.  So,
the negative of a complex number is represented as the visually more familiar
&quot;` -u A `&quot; rather than the more tedious &quot;` ( -u `` A ) `&quot;.
One drawback is that we have to prove separately certain theorems such as the
equality theorem ~ negeq instead of being able to reuse the general-purpose
~ fveq2 . Moreover, the bare symbol &quot;` -u `&quot; has no meaning in
isolation, in contrast to say the bare symbol &quot;` sqrt `&quot;, which is
itself a set and can be manipulated as a stand-alone function for various
purposes.
</P>

<P>
Another very important exception is the notation for an <B>operation
value</B>, which is the function value of an ordered pair as defined by
~ df-ov .  It is so commonly used that we adopted the convenient and familiar
notation of three juxtaposed class expressions surrounded by parentheses, such
as "( 3 + 2 )".  While this may appear to be syntactically ambiguous with such
expressions as the union of two classes ( ~ cun ), "` ( A u. B ) `", the
difference is that operation value notation requires that the center symbol be
a class expression:  "+" is a class expression ( ~ caddc ) but a stand-alone
"` u. `" is not.  (We do not define the union of two classes as an operation
because it must work with proper classes as arguments&mdash;not to mention that
the operation value definition ultimately depends on it anyway.)
</P>

<P>
Prefix expressions (those beginning with a constant, such as the unary minus
above, logical negation, and the "for all" quantifier) have tighter binding
than infix expressions and don't require parentheses.  Also, whenever an infix
expression is a predicate&mdash;i.e. has class variable arguments but evaluates
to a wff, such as A = B&mdash;parentheses are not needed for disambiguation.
Some infix predicates that are not surrounded by parentheses are:
<PRE>
A = B
x = y
A e. B
x e. y
A =/= B
A e/ B
A C_ B
A C. B
A R B
R Po A
R Or A
R Fr A
R We A
A Fn B
R _Se A
R _FrSe A
</PRE>
(To find out where say "A Fn B" is defined, type "search * 'A Fn B'" in the
metamath program after reading in set.mm.  In this case, df-fn matches, and you
can look at the web page ~ df-fn for more information.)

In the set.mm database, there are 10 other axiom schemes of predicate calculus
( ~ ax-c4 , ~ ax-c5 , ~ ax-c7 , ~ ax-c9 , ~ ax-c10 , ~ ax-c11 , ~ ax-c11n ,
~ ax-c14 , ~ ax-c15 , and ~ ax-c16 ) that are not included in our "official"
list of 10 <A HREF="#pcaxioms">predicate calculus axiom schemes</A> (and one
rule) above, because they can be derived as theorems from the official ones.
These used to be part of our official list but were removed or replaced as
redundancies and simplifications were found.  We have kept them in a deprecated
section of set.mm for historical purposes, and they are not used outside of
that section.  Each of these obsolete axioms is proved as a theorem whose name
is the same with the "-" omitted.  For example, obsolete axiom ~ ax-c5 is
proved as theorem ~ axc5 from using axioms ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-13 .
</P>

<P>
Axioms with names starting "ax-c" are part of system S3' in Remark 9.6 of
[<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>]; for example, ~ ax-c4 is axiom C4' there.
Axiom ~ ax-c11n was a newer alternative to ~ ax-c11 , although eventually we
proved it redundant (theorem ~ axc11n ).
</P>

<P>
From the set consisting of these 10 obsolete axiom schemes plus the 10 official
ones, several subsystems can be of interest for certain studies.  For brevity,
"axiom" always means "<A HREF="#schemes">axiom scheme</A>" in the table below.
In the table, we assume that all 20 axiom schemes and 1 rule (23 axioms and 2
rules if we include propositional calculus) are present, except for the ones
listed in the "Omit axioms" column.

This is Tarski's system S2 and is logically (though not <I>scheme</I>)

can be derived from the axioms of this subsystem.  However, many schemes with

<B>System with no distinct variables.</B>
This system has no distinct variable constraints, making the concept of
substitution as simple as it can possibly be and also significantly simplifying
the algorithm for verifying proofs.  It is equivalent to system S2 in Section 4
of [<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>].  The primary drawback of this system is
that for it to be considered complete, we must ignore antecedents called
"<A HREF="mmzfcnd.html#distinctors">distinctors</A>" that stand in for what
would be distinct variable constraints (see the linked discussion).
</P>

<P>
We can optionally include ~ ax-c15 or ~ ax-12 for a somewhat more powerful
metalogic, since these also involve no distinct variable restrictions (although
without them we can still derive any instance of them not containing wff
metavariables).

<P>
The subsystem <A HREF="ax-4.html">ax-1</A> through ~ ax-11 , ~ ax-mp , and
~ ax-gen , i.e. the axioms not involving equality, is weaker than traditional
predicate calculus without equality (i.e. that omits the equality axioms
labeled stdpc6 and stdpc7 in the table in the
<A HREF="#traditional">traditional predicate calculus</A> section).
The reason is that traditional predicate calculus incorporates proper
substitution as part of its metalogic, whereas in our system proper
substitution is accomplished directly by the logic itself through our more
complex axioms ~ ax-7 through ~ ax-5 .  In our system, substitution and
equality are intimately tied in with each other.  This "pure" subsystem in
effect represents the fragment of logic that remains when equality, proper
substitution, and the concept of distinct variables are completely
stripped out.  Interestingly, if we map "for all" to "necessity" and
omit ~ ax-11 from the "pure" subsystem, the result is exactly the modal logic
system known as S5 (thanks to Bob Meyer for pointing this out).  See also
Item 12 on the <A HREF="../award2003.html#12">Workshop Miscellany</A> page.
</P>

<P>
Optionally, we can replace ~ ax-4 and ~ ax-10 with ~ ax-c4 and ~ ax-c7
(provided we replace them both) to obtain an equivalent subsystem.  Theorems
~ ax4fromc4 , ~ ax10fromc7 , ~ axc4 , and ~ axc7 prove the equivalence.  In
this subsystem, ~ axc5c711 can replace ~ ax-c5 , ~ ax-c7 , and ~ ax-11 .

On 20-Dec-2018, the <A HREF="#pcaxioms">predicate calculus</A> axiom schemes
were renumbered to eliminate gaps caused by obsolete or redundant axiom
schemes, as well as to order them according to their current organization.
Older papers, slide presentations, and websites may reference the old

Axioms with names starting "ax-c" are now obsolete, but they were part of
system S3' in Remark 9.6 of [<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>]; for example,
~ ax-c4 is axiom C4' there.  Axiom ~ ax-c11n was a newer alternative to
~ ax-c11 , although eventually we proved it redundant (theorem ~ axc11n ).
Axiom C5 (not primed) is taken from system S3 but is included in S3' as stated
in the paper.  The obsolete axioms ~ ax-c4 through ~ ax-c16 are kept for
historical reasons in a deprecated section of set.mm and shouldn't be used
outside of that section.
</P>

<P>
In the "Proof" column, the referenced theorem has two meanings.  In the rows
for new axiom numbers ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-13 , the "Proof" column theorem shows
a proof of the axiom from the obsolete ones ~ ax-c4 through ~ ax-c16 .  This is
useful to see how our current axioms can be derived from the original ones in
[<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>].  In the rows for ~ ax-c4 through ~ ax-c16 ,
the "Proof" column theorem shows a derivation of the obsolete axiom from our
current system ~ ax-4 through ~ ax-13 .  Together, these proofs show that our
current system is equivalent to the one in [<A HREF="#bibmegill">Megill</A>].

Logic and set theory provide a foundation for all of mathematics.  One possible
way to start to learn about them is to use the Metamath Proof Explorer in
conjunction with one or more textbooks listed in the Bibliography of the next
section.  The textbooks provide a motivation for what we are doing, whereas the
Metamath Proof Explorer lets you see in detail all hidden and implicit steps.
Most standard theorems are accompanied by <A HREF="mmbiblio.html">literature
cross references</A>, and it will probably be easier to acquire a higher-level
understanding of them if you consult these.

For propositional and predicate calculus, Margaris is now available in an
inexpensive Dover edition and is reasonably readable for beginners, once you
get used to the archaic dot notation used in place of parentheses.  Our 19.x
series of theorems, such as ~ 19.35 , corresponds to Margaris' handy predicate
calculus table on pp. 89-90.  Hirst and Hirst's on-line <I>A Primer for Logic
and Proof</I>, mentioned <A HREF="#traditional">above</A>, uses modern notation
and is also highly recommended.
</P>

<P>
For set theory, Quine is wonderfully written and a pleasure to read.  The first
part on virtual classes (pp. 15-21) is a must-read if you want to understand
our <FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">purple</FONT> class variables (which in Quine are
Greek letters).  (See also the <A HREF="#class">Theory of Classes</A> above.)
Quine also uses the archaic dot notation, but this is really a very minor
hurdle, especially since you can compare the Metamath versions of many of the
theorems.  Takeuti and Zaring is the set theory reference we follow most
closely, including most of our notation, and its rigor makes it straightforward
to formalize proofs; but some people find it a dry and technical read, and it
is also out of print.  Suppes, which is available in a Dover edition, goes to
extremes to <I>avoid</I> virtual classes, leading to bizarre theorems like "the
set of all sets is empty" (Theorem 50, p. 35); nonetheless, it provides a
gentle introduction that we reference surprisingly frequently.
</P>

<P>
Margaris and Quine give only an informal explanation of their dot notation that
may not satisfy everyone.  A good explanation can be found in Copi's
<I>Symbolic Logic</I> (5th edition), Section 9.3, with multiple examples.
(Thanks to Patrick Clot for this suggestion.)

<FONT COLOR="#006633">Browsing with the Unicode font </FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By default, the Metamath Proof Explorer uses a Unicode font for math symbols.
Some browsers may render Unicode incorrectly, although the problem is becoming
less frequent.  On each page with a proof, at the top there is a link to switch
to the GIF version.  You will stay in the GIF directory (you will see "mpegif"
instead of "mpeuni" in the URL) until you switch back to the Unicode font
version on a page with a proof.
</P>

<!--
<P>
Unfortunately, Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 do not implement some of the
standard Unicode math symbols, which is
<A HREF="../symbols/symbols.html#why">why</A> I chose GIF images as the
default.  The missing symbols are displayed as
<A HREF="../fontcompare.gif">blank rectangular boxes</A>, making the page
unreadable.  The free <A HREF="http://mozilla.org/">Firefox and
Mozilla</A> [retrieved 21-Dec-2016] browsers implement them correctly.
Safari on MacOS X (10.3.9) has also been reported to work.
</P>
-->

<P>
If you know of any browsers that work correctly with Metamath's Unicode
symbols, let me know so that I can put the information here.  To check for
correctness, compare the symbols in Unicode and GIF versions of the
<A HREF="mmascii.html">ASCII token chart</A>.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="font"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Display font</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since some people spend a great deal of time studying this site, I purposely
left the main font unspecified so that you can choose the one you find the most
comfortable.  In Firefox, select Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Content -&gt;
Default font.  In Internet Explorer 11, select (gear symbol) -&gt; Internet
Options -&gt; General -&gt; Fonts.  On Windows, Times New Roman is the standard
font.  If you prefer a sans-serif font, Arial will align correctly with our
math symbol GIF images.  By the way, the minty green background color
(#EEFFFA=r238,g255,b250) used for the proofs was chosen because it has been
claimed to be less fatiguing for long periods of work, but most browsers will
let you override it if you wish.
</P>

<!--
<P>
If you are viewing the GIF version of these pages, the appearance may be more
consistent if font antialiasing is turned off.  If you are viewing the Unicode
version, the Unicode symbols may be more legible if it is turned on.
</P>
-->

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Viewing with a text browser</FONT></B>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The GIF version of the Metamath Proof Explorer can be viewed with a text-only
browser.  All symbols will be shown as the <A HREF="mmascii.html">ASCII
tokens</A> shown in the set.mm source file.  The most common text browser,
Lynx, does not format tables, making proofs somewhat confusing to read.  But
good results are achieved with the table-formatting text browser
<A HREF="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</A> [retrieved 21-Dec-2016].
</P>

<P>
One advantage of a text browser is that you can select and copy the formulas in
a convenient ASCII form that can be pasted into text documents, emails, etc.
(The Mozilla browser will also do this if the copy buffer is pasted into a text
editor.)  Text browsers are also extremely fast if you have a slow connection.
If you are blind, a text browser can make this site accessible, although for
theorem and proof displays, direct use of the Metamath program CLI
(command-line interface) might be more efficient&mdash;I would be interested in
any feedback on this.
