<B><FONT COLOR="#006633">On the variables in the ZFC
axioms</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of our <A
HREF="mmset.html#zfcaxioms">standard ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel
with Choice) set theory axioms</A> is accompanied by
the proviso that all of its setvar variables be <A
HREF="mmset.html#distinct">distinct</A> from each other.  This is
indicated by the "Distinct variable group" on its web page
(for example <A HREF="ax-ext.html">ax-ext</A>) and
corresponds to its $d restriction in the database source file, <A
HREF="../index.html#mmprog">set.mm</A>.

<P>Each "axiom" in Metamath's version of ZFC set theory is not an actual
axiom in the language of first-order logic but is a <A
HREF="mmset.html#schemes"><I>scheme</I></A> or template that represents
an infinite number of actual axioms.  From the point of view of
first-order logic, the <FONT COLOR=red>setvar</FONT> and <FONT
COLOR=blue>wff</FONT> "variables" are metavariables that range over the
individual variables and wffs of the language of the actual logic.  This
is the way Metamath&mdash;"metavariable math"&mdash;works; it doesn't have a
way of directly representing an individual variable or a single actual axiom.

<P>Most textbooks, on the other hand, state the ZFC axioms (except
Replacement, which necessarily has a wff metavariable) as specific
actual axioms in the language of first-order logic.  So, for example,
they will state the Axiom of Extensionality as a single actual axiom
with fixed individual variables, not a scheme ranging over an infinite
number of actual axioms.  To recover the textbook version from
Metamath's version, we simply make a fixed assignment of individual
variables to our setvar metavariables, outside of Metamath; in other
words, we pick any instance of the scheme that our Axiom of Extensionality
statement represents.  The math works
out exactly the same, because we have attached provisos to our standard
version of the ZFC axioms stating that their setvar metavariables must be
distinct from each other, and a metatheorem of predicate calculus states
that the truth of an axiom is not affected by renaming its variables
as long as the variable names remain distinct.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">ZFC axioms without distinct variable
conditions</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to exploit the
fact that we are using metavariables instead of individual variables in
the following interesting way.  We can use various logic tricks to
formulate an equivalent set of ZFC axiom schemes that have <B>no</B>
distinct variable provisos.  Here we show such a set, proved as
theorems from the standard ones.  Accompanying them is an optional simple
additional scheme, which we have called the Axiom of Twoness, that does
have a proviso and will be discussed below.

<P>The axioms below can be added to a
<A HREF="mmset.html#dvfreesystem">predicate calculus system with no distinct
variables</A> to obtain a logically complete set of axioms for
logic and set theory.

<P> To prove that they really are equivalent, we also rederive the

HREF="zfcndac.html">rederivation of Choice</A>.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Remarks</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an
axiom scheme with no distinct variable restrictions, the complicated
rules for free variables and proper substitution, needed to avoid
distinct variable clashes, disappear.  A quantified ("bound") variable
loses its special status, and the concept of a quantified variable's
scope vanishes&mdash;all variables become "global" throughout the
expression.  Think about what that means&mdash;it is a rather startling and
even counterintuitive property if you are used to working with
first-order logic.  For example, in our condition-free Axiom of Union, we
can blindly change all of its free and bound setvar variables to ` x ` ,
and the strange-looking result,
` |- E. x A. x ( E. x ( x e. x /\ x e. x ) -> x e. x ) ` , is still a sound
(although probably not very useful) theorem scheme of set theory!
Among other things, such axiom schemes are trivial to manipulate
with a computer program, since the "for all" and "there exists"
quantifiers effectively become simple binary operations.

<P>Most mathematicians are used to free and bound variables being
intrinsically distinct (which they are in the <I>actual</I> axioms of
logic&mdash;again, see the <A HREF="mmset.html#schemes">note on the
axioms</A>), and this version may make some of them grimace, which is
why I didn't put them on the main Metamath Proof Explorer page.
Certainly they are more difficult to grasp intuitively, and I would not
advocate using them as the starting point for a set theory course,
although they might provide interesting exercises that stress a student's
understanding of free and bound variables.

<!--
<P>Nonetheless, I think it is remarkable that the need for distinct
variables in the axiom schemes for (essentially) <I>all of
mathematics</I> can be distilled down to a single simple axiom scheme,
which I call the "Axiom of Twoness," that in essence asserts merely that
at least two things exist.
-->

<P><A NAME="twoness"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Axiom of
Twoness</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The axiom above that I have
dubbed the "Axiom of Twoness" in essence asserts merely that
at least two things exist.
When added to
the axioms of our <A HREF="mmset.html#dvfreesystem">predicate calculus
system with no distinct variables</A>, the Axiom of Twoness implies <A
HREF="ax-c16.html">ax-c16</A> (as shown by theorem <A
HREF="axc16b.html">axc16b</A>) and therefore all instances of <A
HREF="ax-5.html">ax-5</A>, making those two axioms of predicate
calculus unnecessary for logical completeness.  This means that the need
for distinct variables in mathematics is completely captured by the Axiom
of Twoness, a fact that I think is somewhat remarkable.

<P>One way to look at the Axiom of Twoness is not as axiom of set theory
but as an axiom of a somewhat stronger and less general predicate
calculus, where the domain of discourse is assumed to contain at least
two objects.  (The ordinary assumption in predicate calculus is that at
least one object exists.  Even this assumption is somewhat arbitrary and
made for convenience in standard predicate calculus.  There are more
complex versions of predicate calculus called "free logics" that allow
the domain of discourse to be empty.)

<P>My conjecture is that the Axiom of Twoness, and not just the weaker
Axiom of Distinct Variables <A HREF="ax-c16.html">ax-c16</A>, is necessary
for completeness.  Specifically, I haven't been able to <A
HREF="zfcndpow.html">rederive</A> the standard Axiom of Power Sets (nor
the standard Axiom of Infinity, which uses it for its rederivation) from
our condition-free version without invoking the Axiom of Twoness, nor
have I been able to find any other condition-free version of Power Sets
that would let me do this.

<P><I>Update 11-Apr-2018:</I> Beno&icirc;t Jubin has shown that
the Axiom of Twoness is necessary to rederive the standard
axioms of Power Sets and Infinity.  See
<A HREF="../award2003.html#14">item 14</A> on the
"Open problems and miscellany" page.

<P><A NAME="distinctors"></A><B><FONT
COLOR="#006633">Distinctors</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any way
to avoid the Axiom of Twoness, or more generally any need for distinct
variable provisos at all?  Yes and yes, provided that we are willing to
live with theorems prefixed with antecedents of the form

"` -. A. x x = y `",

which I call "distinctors," in place of explicitly requiring ` x ` and ` y `
to be distinct variables.  But the
list of distinctors needed for a theorem can grow quite long, as it will
accumulate all the "dummy" variables used in the theorem's proof, even if
those variables do not appear in the main part of the theorem.  It is
theoretically impossible to avoid dummy variables, which was proved by a
theorem of Andr&eacute;ka and is discussed in my paper, "<A
HREF="mmset.html#bibmegill">A Finitely Axiomatized Formalization of
Predicate Calculus with Equality</A>."

<P>Nonetheless, for informal display purpose we could drop the distinctors
having dummy variables not occurring in the theorem.  For more precise
communication, we  could abbreviate the list of distinctors for
dummy variables
with a notation such "d(7)", meaning that distinctors for 7 dummy
variables are implicit in the antecedent.  In this way, we could derive
essentially all of mathematics from a system having no distinct variable
requirements, without an excessive notational burden for the
accumulation of distinctors.

<!--
  Nonetheless, we can postpone the
application of the Axiom of Twoness until the very end of the proof,
using it to trim off redundant distinctors (i.e. those containing dummy
variables) in a trivial algorithmic way.  If we view this as just a
postprocessing clean-up "outside" of the proof for the benefit of
readability, it means that in principle the no distinct variables at all
are needed for mathematics.
(From a practical point of view,
the explicit manipulation of distinctors is tedious and results in long
proofs, so such a system is mostly only of theoretical interest.)
-->

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006633">Interdependence</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although these condition-free axioms are provably equivalent as a group
to the standard ZFC axioms, it should be noted that there is a sense in
which they are not "pure" individually.  At the end of their proofs, in
the list of axioms used, you can see that some of them involve the use
of set theory axioms other than the ones they correspond to.  For
example, one of the tricks we use is the fact that ` A. x y e. `
` z ` evaluates to ` y e. z ` if all three variables are mutually distinct, and
false otherwise.  To prove this we need the Axiom of Regularity, so that
any axiom using this trick incorporates a component derived from
Regularity.  So for some purposes, such as studying the independence of the
standard ZFC axioms, they are not suitable as a replacement for the
standard ones.
