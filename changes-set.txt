This is part of an ongoing project to improve naming consistency.  If you have
suggestions for better names, let us know. It lists changes in set.mm (for
iset.mm, see the git history, although many of the proposed or historical
changes described here also apply to iset.mm, or should be adopted in iset.mm
when someone gets the chance).

To update your mathbox, you can make global substitutions into
your local version by processing the ones WITHOUT "Notes" in REVERSE order.
The ones WITH "Notes" may have to be processed manually.

proposed  sylib     imbitri     etc.
proposed  sylbid    biimtrd     etc.
proposed  sylbird   biimtrrd    etc.
proposed  syl5*     *trid       (syl5bi -> biimtrid; syl5eqel -> eqeltrid;etc.)
proposed  syl6*     *trdi
proposed  *mpt*     *mpf* or *mptf* (maps-to for functions)
proposed  *mpt2*    *mpo* or *mpto* (maps-to for operations)
(Please send any comments on these proposals to the mailing list or
make a github issue.)
